YOUR PATTERN (Based on Your Answers)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IF MOSTLY A's: THE UNMAPPED EXECUTOR
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're a natural action-taker.

But your actions aren't compounding toward anything specific.

You're working hard but not building momentum.

THE PATTERN:
You take massive action. You're never idle. You're constantly doing.

But at the end of 90 days, you look back and realize: none of it added up.

You've been running hard in 10 different directions.

No single direction got your full force.

THE COST:
You reach a ceiling faster than strategists.

Your scattered energy means nothing compounds.

You look busy. You feel busy. But you're not building anything that lasts.

WHAT BREAKS IT:
Direction.

Channel your natural action-drive toward a specific vision.

Stop jumping between 10 things.

Pick one. Commit to it for 90 days. Let the rest go.

Your strength isn't the problem. Your lack of focus is.

Tomorrow's email will show you how to direct your energy.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IF MOSTLY B's: THE ANALYSIS-LOCKED STRATEGIST
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You plan everything perfectly.

But you never execute.

By the time you're ready, the moment has passed.

THE PATTERN:
You're brilliant at strategy. You see 10 steps ahead. You anticipate problems.

But you won't move until everything is perfect.

85% ready? Not good enough. You need 100%.

So you keep planning. And planning. And planning.

THE COST:
Good ideas that never launch.

Years of "almost but never done."

Other people—less qualified than you—are succeeding because they started before they were ready.

You're still perfecting the plan.

WHAT BREAKS IT:
Permission to start at 85% ready.

Imperfect action beats perfect planning.

Set a launch date. Non-negotiable. 7 days from now.

Launch at 85%. Get real feedback from real people.

Iterate based on what you learn (not more planning).

Tomorrow's email will show you why your brain keeps you stuck in planning mode.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IF MOSTLY C's: THE ISOLATED HIGH-ACHIEVER
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're competent and talented.

But completely alone in your decisions.

No counsel. No accountability. Just you trying to figure it out.

THE PATTERN:
You got here by being independent.

Early in your career, self-reliance was your superpower.

But now? You're making million-dollar decisions in isolation.

You have no one to challenge your thinking.

No one to see your blind spots.

No one to tell you when you're wrong.

THE COST:
Slower growth. Burnout. Blind spots you can't see.

A ceiling you hit alone that you could break with the right counsel.

WHAT BREAKS IT:
Build a mastermind.

Get strategic counsel from people who've been where you're going.

Stop carrying everything alone.

Multiply your impact through leverage.

You don't need to do it all yourself. You need to lead a team (even if it's just 2-3 peers).

Tomorrow's email will show you why isolation is keeping you stuck.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IF MOSTLY D's: THE PERMISSION-SEEKER
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're waiting for someone to tell you you're ready.

But you're already qualified.

You just don't believe it.

THE PATTERN:
You doubt your competence despite all evidence to the contrary.

You've accomplished impressive things.

But you still feel like an imposter.

You're waiting for external validation.

A credential. A promotion. A sign. Someone saying "you're ready now."

But that permission isn't coming.

THE COST:
Delayed success.

Lost years waiting for permission that's not coming.

Other people—less qualified than you—are succeeding because they granted themselves permission.

You're still waiting.

WHAT BREAKS IT:
Grant yourself permission.

Build evidence of your competence (write down 10 past wins).

Move without waiting for external validation.

Let success be your permission.

Tomorrow's email will show you why your brain seeks external permission and how to break it.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IF MOSTLY E's: THE INHERITED-IDENTITY PRISONER
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You look successful.

But you're living someone else's script.

Your success feels empty because it's not yours.

THE PATTERN:
You're achieving someone else's vision of success.

Your parents' dream. Your industry's expectations. Society's definition of "making it."

You're good at it. You're even succeeding at it.

But it doesn't feel like yours.

You wake up and think: "Is this it?"

THE COST:
Burnout building someone else's vision.

Years in the wrong life.

Success that feels hollow because it's not aligned with your values.

WHAT BREAKS IT:
Claim your own identity.

Build YOUR vision (not theirs).

Align your work with your values.

Get quiet. Ask: What do I actually want? (Remove all "shoulds.")

Then make one brave choice that's authentically you.

Tomorrow's email will show you why you inherited this identity and how to reclaim yours.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

YOUR NEXT STEPS:

Tomorrow (Email 2): I'll show you the mechanism—why your pattern keeps repeating.

Day 3 (Email 3): I'll give you your first concrete action.

For now: Just know your pattern.

That awareness is the first step to breaking it.

See you tomorrow,

[Your Name]
IGNITE Team

P.S. Reply and tell me your pattern. I read every response.
