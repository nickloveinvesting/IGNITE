## 🔧 OPTIMIZATION TRIGGERS

### 🚨 If Opt-In Rate < 20%

3. Add urgency ("Limited time assessment available")
4. Strengthen social proof (add more testimonials)
5. Test video placement (move above fold)

7. Test different CTA button text ("Start Assessment" instead of "Start Decoder")

**Timeline:** Make changes within 3-5 days if opt-in <20%

---

### 🚨 If Email 1 Open Rate < 40%

**Problem:** Subject line not compelling or deliverability issue

**Actions:**
1. Test new subject lines:
   - "[FirstName], Your Assessment Results Are Ready"
   - "See Why You're Stuck (60-Second Read)"
2. Check spam score (use Mail-Tester.com)
3. Verify domain authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)

6. Review preview text (first 50 characters after subject)

**Timeline:** Test new subject line within 2-3 days

---

### 🚨 If Email 1 Engagement < 25%

**Actions:**

4. Send reminder 24h later to non-openers

**Timeline:** Test within 3 days

4. Address objections directly (cost, time commitment, skepticism)
5. Offer alternative CTA (free resource download for those not ready)
6. Send follow-up email to non-bookers:
   - Subject: "Not ready yet? (Here's what to do)"
   - Content: Nurture relationship, softer IGNITE mention
7. Create scarcity (only 50 spots, 10 already taken)

**Timeline:** Test new messaging within 5 days

---

### 🚨 If Cost Per Lead > $5

**Problem:** Ad targeting too broad or creative not resonating

**Actions:**

4. Pause worst-performing ad variation

**Timeline:** Implement within 1 week

---

3. Add urgency to call (limited spots, bonuses for enrolling on call)
4. Follow up with "think about it" leads within 24h
5. Record calls and analyze (where are objections happening?)

Unlike niche magnets, this targets **anyone stuck** (largest addressable market). Every high-achiever experiences stuck at some point.

### 2. Multi-Touch Superiority
3-email sequences generate **51-160% better results** than single emails (research-backed).

### 3. Assessment-Based Personalization
Interactive assessments drive **47% higher engagement** than static content. People love discovering things about themselves.

### 4. Transformation Journey
The sequence IS the product (shows what IGNITE does). By Email 3, they've experienced a mini-version of the full program.

### 5. Fast Decision-Making
3 days = quick results = fast decision on IGNITE. Long sequences lose momentum.

### 6. Proven Mechanisms
- Epiphany Bridge (Russell Brunson): Emotional breakthrough before logic

- Before/After Framework: Proven transformation visual

### 7. Low Barrier to Entry
5-minute assessment + 3 short emails = minimal commitment required. Easy to say yes.

### 8. Clear Pathway to IGNITE
Email 3 naturally leads to strategy call. No forced transition. The decoder proves the value, making the IGNITE offer feel like the obvious next step.
