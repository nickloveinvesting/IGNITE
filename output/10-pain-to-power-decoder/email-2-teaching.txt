EMAIL BODY (Plain Text Format - Copy Below)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Hi [FirstName],

Yesterday you discovered your stuck pattern.

Today I'm showing you WHY it's stuck.

Because understanding the mechanism is everything.

---

HERE'S THE TRUTH:

You didn't choose this pattern.

You fell into it.

Usually because it WORKED at some point.

Think about it:

Your constant action (Executor) kept things moving early in your career.

Your careful planning (Strategist) saved you from costly mistakes.

Your independence (Isolated) was an asset when you were starting out.

Your caution (Permission-Seeker) protected you from reckless moves.

Your responsibility (Inherited-Identity) felt like a strength.

All of those were SMART.

All of those got you here.

But what worked then doesn't work now.

And here's the trap: Your brain doesn't know that.

So it keeps using yesterday's strategy for today's problem.

---

THAT'S WHY YOU'RE STUCK.

Not because you're broken.

Not because you're not smart enough.

Not because you're not trying hard enough.

But because your old solution has become your new problem.

---

LET ME SHOW YOU HOW THIS WORKS:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE MECHANISM (Based on Your Pattern)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FOR THE UNMAPPED EXECUTOR:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Early in your career, taking massive action was the right move.

You didn't have a clear plan. So you experimented. You tried everything.

And something stuck.

That taught your brain: "Action = progress."

So now, whenever you feel stuck, your brain says: "Do more."

Take more action. Try more things. Stay busy.

But here's the problem:

At this stage, MORE action without DIRECTION is just noise.

You're not in the "try everything" phase anymore.

You're in the "focus and compound" phase.

But your brain still thinks action = progress.

So you keep scattering your energy.

And nothing compounds.

THE BREAKTHROUGH:
You don't need more action.

You need directed action.

Same energy. Different target.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FOR THE ANALYSIS-LOCKED STRATEGIST:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Early in your career, careful planning saved you.

You avoided mistakes. You thought ahead. You prepared.

That strategy worked. You succeeded because of it.

Your brain learned: "Planning = safety."

So now, whenever you face uncertainty, your brain says: "Plan more."

Research more. Prepare more. Get to 100% ready.

But here's the problem:

You're never 100% ready. The market changes. New information appears.

So you keep planning. Forever.

Meanwhile, people less qualified than you are succeeding because they launched at 85%.

They're learning from real feedback.

You're still perfecting the plan.

THE BREAKTHROUGH:
Planning isn't keeping you safe anymore. It's keeping you stuck.

The only way to get real feedback is to launch.

Imperfect action beats perfect planning.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FOR THE ISOLATED HIGH-ACHIEVER:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Early in your career, independence was your strength.

You figured things out on your own. You didn't need help.

That self-reliance got you here.

Your brain learned: "I can do this alone."

So now, whenever you face a challenge, your brain says: "Figure it out yourself."

But here's the problem:

The challenges you're facing now are bigger than what you faced then.

You're making decisions with higher stakes.

You're in territory you've never been in before.

And you're still trying to figure it out alone.

No counsel. No perspective. No one to challenge your thinking.

THE BREAKTHROUGH:
Independence got you here. But it won't get you there.

The next level requires leverage—strategic counsel, accountability, partnership.

You don't need to do it all yourself. You need to lead a team.

Even if it's just 2-3 peers who see what you can't.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FOR THE PERMISSION-SEEKER:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Early in your career, caution was smart.

You didn't have experience. You didn't have evidence.

So you waited. You learned. You built competence.

That strategy worked. You avoided costly mistakes.

Your brain learned: "Wait for permission. Get validation first."

So now, whenever you face a big opportunity, your brain says: "Are you sure you're ready?"

And you look for external proof: A credential. A promotion. Someone saying "yes."

But here's the problem:

You're already qualified. You've already proven yourself.

But you're still waiting for someone to tell you you're ready.

That permission isn't coming.

Because the people who could give it assume you already know you're ready.

THE BREAKTHROUGH:
You don't need more credentials. You need to grant yourself permission.

The evidence already exists (your past wins, your results, your competence).

You just haven't looked at it.

Move without waiting for external validation. Let success be your permission.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FOR THE INHERITED-IDENTITY PRISONER:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Early in your life, responsibility was rewarded.

You did what was expected. You met the standard.

Your parents were proud. Your teachers approved. You succeeded.

Your brain learned: "Meet expectations = success."

So now, you're still doing it.

You're achieving someone else's vision of success.

And you're good at it. You're even succeeding at it.

But it doesn't feel like yours.

Because it's not.

THE BREAKTHROUGH:
The life you're living worked for someone else's values.

But not yours.

You've been so busy meeting expectations that you never stopped to ask: What do I actually want?

The first step is getting quiet. Removing all "shoulds."

And asking: If I wasn't worried about disappointing anyone, what would I build?

That answer is your real identity.

Everything else is borrowed.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE PATTERN IS THE SAME FOR EVERYONE:

What worked then doesn't work now.

But your brain keeps using the old strategy.

That's not a flaw. That's how brains work.

They repeat what worked.

Even when it stops working.

---

THE BREAKTHROUGH:

IGNITE isn't trying to change you.

It's showing you how to apply your natural strengths differently.

So your executor energy goes toward a specific vision (not scattered action).

So your strategy creates before-you're-ready momentum (not paralysis).

So your independence becomes partnership (not isolation).

So your caution becomes self-permission (not waiting).

So your responsibility becomes authentic (not inherited).

---

THAT'S WHAT CHANGES EVERYTHING:

Not becoming someone different.

But becoming YOU—applied powerfully to YOUR vision.

---

YOUR FIRST STEP:

Tomorrow (final email), I'm giving you your first action.

One concrete step toward unstuck.

Your escape route.

See you tomorrow,

[Your Name]

P.S. Notice: This is exactly what IGNITE does over 28 days.

We identify your pattern. Teach the mechanism. Give you daily practices.

Tomorrow's email will show you what that first step looks like.

If this is resonating, you might be ready for the full program.

More on that tomorrow.

TECHNICAL NOTES FOR EMAIL PLATFORM SETUP
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

AUTOMATION SETUP:
1. Trigger: 24-48 hours after Email 1 sent
2. Delay: 24 hours (recommended) or 48 hours
3. Send time: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM or 3-7 PM (subscriber timezone)
4. Personalization: {FirstName} merge tag
5. Advanced: Personalize mechanism section based on pattern tag from Email 1
6. Opens/clicks tracking: Enable

PERSONALIZATION OPTIONS (Advanced):

If your email platform supports conditional content:
- Tag subscribers based on their assessment result in Email 1
- Show ONLY their specific pattern mechanism
- Hide other patterns
- This increases relevance and reduces email length

Example conditional logic:
IF [Pattern] = "Executor" THEN show Executor mechanism
IF [Pattern] = "Strategist" THEN show Strategist mechanism
etc.

Platforms that support this: ActiveCampaign, HubSpot, ConvertKit (with some workarounds)

MOBILE OPTIMIZATION CHECKLIST:
☐ Subject line under 40 characters
☐ Single-column layout
☐ Minimum 14px font size
☐ Pattern sections clearly separated visually
☐ Fast image/video loading
☐ Left-aligned text
☐ Clear visual hierarchy

A/B TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:

Test 1: Subject Line
- Variant A: "Why Your Pattern Keeps Repeating (The Real Reason)"
- Variant B: "[FirstName], Here's Why You're Stuck"
- Measure: Open rate

Test 2: Video vs. Text Only
- Variant A: Include 2-3 min video explaining mechanism
- Variant B: Text-only explanation
- Measure: Engagement time, click-through to Email 3

Test 3: Personalized vs. All Patterns
- Variant A: Show only subscriber's specific pattern (requires tagging)
- Variant B: Show all 5 patterns, let them find theirs
- Measure: Read time, reply rate

SUCCESS METRICS TO TRACK:
- Open rate: Target 42-48%
- Click rate: Target 25-30% (if including video or links)
- CTOR (Click-to-Open Rate): Target 12-15%
- Reply rate: Track replies (indicates resonance)
- Time to open Email 3: Track how quickly they open next email
- Unsubscribe rate: <0.5%

ENGAGEMENT SIGNALS:
High engagement on Email 2 indicates:
- Pattern resonated (assessment was accurate)
- Teaching created "aha moment" (epiphany bridge working)
- Subscriber is moving toward Email 3 action
- High likelihood of IGNITE interest

Low engagement on Email 2 may indicate:
- Subject line didn't create curiosity
- Email too long (consider personalizing to show only their pattern)
- Timing was off (test different send times)
- Pattern didn't resonate (assessment needs refinement)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

For subscribers who OPEN but DON'T CLICK:
- They're reading but not taking action
- Email 3 should create urgency
- Consider: "You're close to breakthrough" messaging

For subscribers who DON'T OPEN Email 2:
- Re-send with different subject line after 48 hours
- Subject: "Did you miss this? (Your pattern explanation)"
- This is common for Email 2 (lower open rates than Email 1)
- Don't skip to Email 3 if they haven't opened Email 2

For subscribers who REPLY:
- Personal response from you (or team)
- Acknowledge their pattern
- Tease Email 3: "Tomorrow's email gives you your first action"
- Nurture relationship (these are your highest-intent leads)
