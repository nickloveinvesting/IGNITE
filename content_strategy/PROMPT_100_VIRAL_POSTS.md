2. **Detailed visual description** (for AI image generation with Gemini/Midjourney)

## Step 2: Key Context from Team Meeting

**Critical Insights to Apply:**

1. **The 3 E's Rule:** Entertainment + Emotion = Viral. Education keeps them. Lead with entertainment/emotion, not education.

2. **Raw > Polished:** Authentic, behind-the-scenes content outperforms polished content. Previous landlord/tenant drama content got 60,000-130,000 views.

3. **Current Challenge:** Only ~25,000 total followers across all platforms. Need to build awareness fast.

4. **Target:** 500 people on Monday IGNITE calls within 45 days.

5. **Pricing:** IGNITE is $19.95/month (December special, down from $99.95).

6. **Founder:** Toby Potter - direct, no-nonsense, action-oriented voice.

7. **What Works:** Story-based content, controversy, vulnerability, specific numbers, journey documentation.

8. **Platform Focus:** Need to improve TikTok presence especially. LinkedIn has high-value audience.

---

## Step 3: Brand Voice Guidelines

**Toby Potter Style:**
- **Direct:** Get to the point immediately. No preamble.
- **Authoritative:** Speak with conviction. No hedging.
- **Action-Oriented:** Every statement points to action.
- **No-Nonsense:** Call out excuses. Demand responsibility.
- **Empowering:** Build people up while pushing forward.

**Avoid:**
- Corporate jargon
- Passive voice
- Hedging language ("might," "perhaps," "possibly")
- Excessive politeness
- Academic tone

**Brand Colors:**
- Fire Orange: #FF4D00 (CTAs, headlines, energy)
- Charcoal: #2C3539 (body text, backgrounds)
- White: #FFFFFF (space, contrast)

natural lighting, authentic moment, not posed,
slight grain for authenticity, warm tones, 4:5 aspect ratio"
```

### For Confrontational/Wake-Up Posts:
```
"High contrast black and white image, intense direct eye contact,
dramatic lighting from one side, bold expression,
text overlay in fire orange (#FF4D00), powerful and commanding mood"
```

### For Framework/Educational Posts (Carousels):
```
"Clean infographic style, charcoal (#2C3539) background,
white text, fire orange (#FF4D00) accent elements,
numbered steps clearly visible, modern sans-serif typography,
minimalist design, 1:1 aspect ratio"
```

### For Story/Vulnerability Posts:
```
"Authentic moment of reflection, person looking thoughtfully
out window or sitting alone, soft natural lighting,
muted colors with slight warmth, emotional and introspective mood,
cinematic composition, 4:5 aspect ratio"
