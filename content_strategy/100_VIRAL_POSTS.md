## Post #1: "The Lie You Tell Yourself Every Morning"

**Platform:** Instagram/TikTok (Primary) | LinkedIn (Secondary)
**Post Type:** Reel/Video (60 seconds)

### Visual Description
**Style:** Raw, direct-to-camera in dim lighting. Toby in a simple black shirt, slight shadows on face. No fancy setup - looks like 6am before the world wakes up.
**Mood:** Intense, intimate, confrontational
**Text Overlay:** "THE LIE" in bold Fire Orange (#FF4D00) appears at hook moment
**Aspect Ratio:** 9:16

**AI Prompt for Gemini:**
"Cinematic portrait of a determined man in his 40s, direct eye contact with camera, early morning dim lighting from one side, black t-shirt, slight stubble, intense but caring expression, dark moody background, grain texture for authenticity, 9:16 vertical format for social media"

### Caption

**Hook:**
You tell yourself the same lie every single morning.

**Body:**
"I'll start Monday."
"I'll do it when I'm ready."
"I just need the right moment."

That moment doesn't exist.

You're not waiting for the right time.
You're waiting for the fear to go away.

It won't.

The fear doesn't leave. You just stop letting it drive.

I wasted 3 years waiting to feel ready. You know what finally changed? I stopped asking permission from my own excuses.

**CTA:**
What are you pretending to wait for? Comment below. Be honest.

**AI Prompt for Gemini:**
"Minimalist corporate photograph of an empty office chair at a clean desk, dramatic side lighting, shadows, slightly desaturated colors with warm orange accent from window light, professional but moody atmosphere, 1:1 square format"

### Caption

**Hook:**
I fired my highest performer last year.

**Body:**
Everyone thought I was insane.

"He brings in 40% of the revenue!"
"You can't afford to lose him!"

Here's what they didn't see:

→ Three people quit because of him
→ Two more were about to
→ The entire team walked on eggshells
→ Meetings became minefields

He was a producer. But he was also a destroyer.

The month after he left? Revenue dropped 15%.

Six months later? We were up 60%.

Because the people who stayed? They finally had room to breathe. To create. To lead.

One toxic high-performer will cost you ten good people who leave in silence.

**CTA:**
Who's the person you know you should've let go months ago?

### Caption

**Hook:**
Your comfort zone has a body count.

**Body:**
Every dream you buried.
Every relationship you let die.
Every version of yourself you suffocated.

That's the cost of staying safe.

You think comfort protects you?
It's slowly killing everything you could become.

The cemetery isn't just for people.
It's full of books never written.
Businesses never started.
Conversations never had.
Lives never lived.

Your comfort zone isn't a sanctuary.
It's a tomb you're building around yourself.

Get out before you finish the walls.

**CTA:**
Save this for the day you need permission to leave. You have it.

## Post #4: "What My Divorce Taught Me About Business"

**Platform:** Instagram/LinkedIn (Primary)
**Post Type:** Single Image + Long Caption

### Visual Description
**Style:** Simple, vulnerable. Black and white or muted tones. Could be a photo of two chairs at a table - one empty. Or hands removing a wedding ring. Symbolic, not literal.
**Mood:** Reflective, honest, somber but hopeful
**Text Overlay:** Minimal - just "Lessons from loss" in small text
**Aspect Ratio:** 4:5 for Instagram

**AI Prompt for Gemini:**
"Artistic black and white photograph of two coffee cups on a wooden table, one full and one empty, morning light streaming through window creating shadows, melancholic but beautiful mood, minimalist composition, slight grain, 4:5 aspect ratio"

### Caption

**Hook:**
My divorce was the best business education I never wanted.

**Body:**
Here's what failure in marriage taught me about success in everything else:

1. **Presence beats promises.**
I promised I'd be there. I wasn't. Not really.
In business: Saying you care means nothing. Showing up means everything.

2. **Small things compound.**
Every skipped dinner. Every "I'm busy." Every half-listened conversation.
In business: The details you ignore become the culture you create.

3. **You can be right and still lose.**
I won every argument. And lost the person.
In business: Being right doesn't build relationships. Being kind does.

4. **Growth requires two.**
I was growing. She was growing. Just in opposite directions.
In business: Alignment matters more than individual ambition.

5. **Some damage can't be undone.**
There's a point of no return. You won't see it until you've passed it.
In business: Don't wait for crisis to prioritize what matters.

I share this because the mask of success is exhausting.

Behind every win is usually a loss we don't talk about.

**CTA:**
What's a painful lesson you're grateful for now?

**Hashtags:**
#vulnerability #lessonslearned #entrepreneurlife #reallife #personalgrowth #divorce #businesslessons #authenticity #growth #hardtruths

Stop saying you don't have time.

**Body:**
You have time.

You watched 3 hours of Netflix last night.
You scrolled for 2 hours yesterday.
You've spent 45 minutes on this app today.

You don't have a time problem.
You have a priority problem.

And that's actually GOOD news.

Because priorities can change in a second.

Right now. This second.

What gets your time gets your life.

So what's getting your life?

"Candid photograph of a man sitting casually on a leather couch, leaning forward engaged in conversation, warm natural lighting from side window, professional but relaxed setting, authentic and approachable, slight bokeh background, 9:16 vertical format"

### Caption

**Hook:**
I almost didn't make the phone call that changed my business.

**Body:**
2019. I needed help. Badly.

There was a guy I'd followed for years. Someone who'd built what I wanted to build. I had his number from a mutual friend.

For 3 weeks, I stared at that number.

"He's too busy."
"He doesn't know me."
"I'll look stupid."
"What would I even say?"

Finally, my wife said: "What's the worst that happens? He says no?"

I called. He answered.

20 minutes later, I had clarity I'd spent 6 months trying to find alone.

One piece of advice from that call generated over $50,000 in the next 90 days.

The thing standing between you and the help you need?

It's not access. It's not money. It's not timing.

It's the story you're telling yourself about why you can't ask.

**CTA:**
Who's the person you've been afraid to reach out to? This is your sign.

**Hashtags:**

## Post #7: "Read This If You're Exhausted But Can't Quit"

**Slide 2:** "First: You're not weak for being tired."
**Slide 3:** "Second: Being tired and being done are different things."

**AI Prompt for Gemini:**
"Minimalist typography design on pure black background, white sans-serif text reading 'Read this if you're exhausted but can't quit', modern clean aesthetic, high contrast, Instagram carousel style, 1:1 square format"

### Caption

**Hook:**
This one's for the ones running on empty.

**Body:**
You're not burnt out because you're weak.
You're burnt out because you've been strong for too long.

But here's what nobody tells you:

Exhaustion lies.

It tells you that quitting is the same as resting.
It tells you that stopping is the same as failing.
It tells you that you can't do this anymore.

But exhaustion doesn't know the future.
It only knows right now.

And right now isn't forever.

Rest if you need to rest.
Reset if you need to reset.
But don't make a permanent decision based on a temporary feeling.

The person you're becoming needs you to keep going.

**CTA:**
Tag someone who needs to hear this today. Or save it for yourself.

**Mood:** Educational, myth-busting, honest
**Colors:** Fire orange accent on the contrast between perception and reality
**Aspect Ratio:** 1:1

**AI Prompt for Gemini:**
"Infographic style split image, left side bright and polished showing success celebration, right side darker showing struggle and hard work, connected by timeline in fire orange (#FF4D00), clean modern design, charcoal (#2C3539) and white color scheme, 1:1 square format"

### Caption

**Hook:**
There's no such thing as an overnight success. Only an overnight discovery.

**Body:**
When people found out about us, they said we "came out of nowhere."

Here's what "nowhere" looked like:

→ 4 years of building in silence
→ 2 failed businesses before this one
→ 847 pieces of content with almost no engagement
→ $127,000 of personal savings invested
→ 3 years of working nights and weekends
→ 1 marriage that almost ended from the stress
→ Countless moments of wanting to quit

Then one day, it clicked.

And suddenly everyone wanted to know our "secret."

The secret is boring. The secret is consistency. The secret is not quitting when nobody's watching.

You're not behind.
You're just in the invisible years.

Keep building.

"Professional portrait of entrepreneur, direct eye contact, subtle smile suggesting they know something you don't, clean minimal background, confident but approachable expression, natural lighting, warm tones, 9:16 vertical format"

### Caption

**Hook:**
I pay $2,000 a month to be told I'm wrong.

**Body:**
Best money I spend.

It's called a coach. A mentor. An accountability partner.

Whatever you call them, here's what they really are:

Someone who sees your blind spots.
Someone who doesn't care about your excuses.
Someone who holds you to who you said you wanted to become.

Most people pay for comfort.
I pay for confrontation.

Because my own brain will always let me off the hook.
My own thoughts will always justify staying the same.
My own patterns will always feel normal.

I don't need someone to tell me I'm great.
I need someone to tell me where I'm slipping.

That's not a cost.
That's an investment in becoming the person who doesn't need the excuses anymore.

**CTA:**
If you had someone who wouldn't let you off the hook - what would change?

## Post #10: "Nobody Talks About This Part"

**Platform:** Instagram/TikTok (Primary)
**Post Type:** Video (90 seconds) - Vulnerable story

### Visual Description
**Style:** Intimate, possibly slightly lower production value intentionally. Could be filmed on phone, sitting somewhere unexpected (car, stairs, late at night). Raw energy.
**Mood:** Vulnerable, honest, the part no one shows
**Text Overlay:** Minimal - let the story carry
**Aspect Ratio:** 9:16

**AI Prompt for Gemini:**
"Candid photograph of person sitting in car at night, dashboard lights creating soft glow on face, contemplative expression, looking slightly off camera, intimate and vulnerable moment, moody atmosphere, 9:16 vertical format"

### Caption

**Hook:**
Nobody talks about the part where you make it... and feel worse.

**Body:**
I hit my first big goal.

And I sat in my car in the parking lot and felt... nothing.

Actually, worse than nothing. I felt empty.

Because I realized I'd spent so long chasing the goal that I'd forgotten to enjoy anything along the way.

I'd missed dinners.
I'd been "present" but not really there.
I'd postponed joy until "I made it."

And then I made it. And the joy wasn't waiting for me.

Here's what I learned:

The goal isn't the point.
Who you become chasing it is the point.
The person you are along the way is the point.

Don't postpone living until you arrive.
You might get there and realize you forgot to pack the things that matter.

**CTA:**
What have you been postponing until you "make it"?

## Post #11: "How to Know If You Should Quit"

**Post Type:** Carousel (6 slides) - Framework

### Visual Description

**Slide 2:** "Quit if: You're running FROM something" / "Stay if: You're running TOWARD something"
**Slide 3:** "Quit if: Your gut has been screaming for months" / "Stay if: It's just a hard season"

**Slide 6:** "The answer isn't always stay. The answer isn't always quit. The answer is: Know yourself well enough to know the difference." - IGNITE

**AI Prompt for Gemini:**
"Clean modern infographic design with split layout, charcoal (#2C3539) background, white text, fire orange (#FF4D00) dividing line between contrasting options, minimalist typography, professional and bold, 1:1 square format"

### Caption

**Hook:**
"Should I quit?" Wrong question.

**Body:**
The right question: "Why do I want to quit?"

Because there's a massive difference between:

Quitting because you're scared
vs.
Quitting because you've outgrown it

Running away from hard
vs.
Running toward better

Stopping because it's uncomfortable
vs.
Stopping because it's wrong

One is avoidance. One is wisdom.

I've quit things I should've stayed with.
I've stayed with things I should've quit.

The difference came down to one thing:
Was I being honest with myself about the real reason?

Fear is a terrible advisor.
But so is stubbornness.

Learn to tell them apart.

**CTA:**
Save this for the next time you're not sure whether to stay or go.

### Caption

**Hook:**
Your network is lying to you. And it's destroying your growth.

**Body:**
Surrounded yourself with people who:
→ "Support" everything you do
→ Never challenge your ideas
→ Make you feel good but not better
→ Won't risk the friendship by telling you the truth

That's not a network. That's an echo chamber.

And it's keeping you stuck.

The people who actually care about you?
They'll tell you the thing you don't want to hear.
They'll question the plan you think is perfect.
They'll disagree because they want you to win, not just feel good.

I don't need people who clap for me.
I need people who'll stop me from walking off a cliff.

Comfort is easy to find.
Truth-tellers are rare.

Find the ones brave enough to risk your approval for your actual success.

**CTA:**
Who's the person who tells you the truth even when it's hard? Tag them. Thank them.

## Post #13: "The Morning Routine That Actually Works"

"Authentic candid photo of a man in casual clothes holding coffee mug, early morning natural light, slightly messy hair, relaxed but alert expression, kitchen or home office background slightly blurred, warm tones, real and relatable, 9:16 vertical format"

### Caption

**Hook:**
Forget the 4am ice bath podcast meditation miracle morning. Here's what actually works.

**Body:**
I tried every morning routine.
The 5am club.
The cold plunges.
The 47-step morning routine.

You know what finally worked?

Something I could actually do. Every day. Even when I'm tired.

My morning routine is 10 minutes:

→ 2 minutes: Write down the one thing that would make today a win
→ 3 minutes: Move my body (push-ups, walk, stretch - doesn't matter)
→ 5 minutes: Work on that one thing before anything else

That's it.

Not sexy. Not Instagram-worthy. But sustainable.

The best routine isn't the most impressive one.
It's the one you'll actually do tomorrow.

And the day after.
And the day after that.

Start stupidly small. Stupid small works.

What's the simplest morning habit that's actually stuck for you?

"Thoughtful portrait of a man in his 40s looking slightly to the side, reflecting, natural soft lighting, professional casual attire, subtle bokeh background, wisdom in expression, warm color grading, cinematic quality, 1:1 square format"

### Caption

**Hook:**
My 25-year-old self needed to hear this. Maybe you do too.

**Body:**
I spent my 20s believing things that weren't true.

That I needed permission.
That I needed to be ready.
That the path would become clear if I just waited long enough.

None of that was real.

The truth? Most of the rules I followed were made up by people who didn't know what they were doing either.

The best things in my life came from:
→ Starting before I was ready
→ Ignoring advice from people who hadn't done it
→ Trusting my gut when logic said otherwise
→ Betting on myself when no one else would

You don't need another year of preparation.
You need 10 minutes of courage.

## Post #15: "Stop Trying to Find Your Passion"

**Platform:** TikTok/Instagram Reels (Primary)
**Post Type:** Video (45 seconds) - Hot take

### Visual Description
**Style:** Direct to camera, slightly aggressive energy. Simple background. One-take feel.
**Mood:** Confrontational, myth-busting
**Text Overlay:** "FIND YOUR PASSION" gets crossed out, replaced with real advice
**Aspect Ratio:** 9:16

**AI Prompt for Gemini:**
"Close-up portrait of a man speaking directly to camera with conviction, simple dark background, dramatic lighting from above, expressive gesturing hands in frame, intense but helpful expression, 9:16 vertical format"

### Caption

**Hook:**
Stop trying to find your passion. It's terrible advice.

**Body:**
"Follow your passion" sounds great.
But it's advice for people who already have one.

What about everyone else?

Here's what actually works:

Don't find your passion.
**Build** your passion.

Try things. Get good at them.
Passion comes from progress.

You don't find passion sitting on your couch thinking.
You find it by doing, failing, learning, and doing again.

I wasn't passionate about what I do now when I started.
I became passionate because I got good at it.
And I got good at it because I did it. A lot.

Action first. Passion follows.

Not the other way around.

**CTA:**
What's something you became passionate about AFTER you started, not before?

## Post #16: "My 3am Rule for Making Hard Decisions"

**Platform:** Instagram/LinkedIn (Primary)
**Post Type:** Single Image + Long Caption

### Visual Description
**Style:** Dark, moody image of clock showing 3am or moonlight through window. Simple, evocative.
**Mood:** Contemplative, serious, wise
**Text Overlay:** "The 3am Rule" in fire orange
**Aspect Ratio:** 4:5

**AI Prompt for Gemini:**
"Moody photograph of moonlight streaming through a window onto a clock showing 3am, dark atmospheric setting, blue-grey tones with warm orange highlight, contemplative mood, minimal composition, cinematic lighting, 4:5 aspect ratio"

### Caption

**Hook:**
Every hard decision I've made right came down to one test.

**Body:**
I call it the 3am Rule.

Before I make a big decision - firing someone, ending a partnership, starting something new - I ask myself:

"If I do this, will I be able to sleep at 3am? Will I feel good about it when it's dark and quiet and there's no one to impress?"

Because at 3am, there's no audience. No performance. Just you and the truth.

At 3am, you can't hide behind logic or justification.
You just know if something is right or wrong.

The decisions that kept me up at night? I knew. I always knew.

The ones I slept soundly after? Those were the right calls - even when they were hard.

Before you make the decision, sit with it. In the quiet. In the dark.

Not what you can justify.
What you can live with.

**CTA:**
What decision has passed your 3am test? Or failed it?

## Post #17: "The Day I Made $0 and Won"

**Platform:** Instagram/LinkedIn (Primary)
**Post Type:** Text + Image

### Visual Description
**Style:** Simple image of an empty bank account or zero on a screen, or contrast with someone celebrating
**Mood:** Counterintuitive, thought-provoking
**Text Overlay:** "$0" in large fire orange text
**Aspect Ratio:** 1:1

**AI Prompt for Gemini:**
"Conceptual minimalist image showing the number zero in bold fire orange (#FF4D00) against charcoal background, clean typography, modern graphic design style, impactful and simple, 1:1 square format"

### Caption

**Hook:**
I had a day where I made $0.
It was one of the best days of my career.

**Body:**
Not because of some hustle culture nonsense about "grinding."

Because of what it taught me.

That day I made $0, I also:
→ Said no to a $15,000 deal that felt wrong
→ Walked away from a client who didn't respect my team
→ Closed my laptop at 5pm and played with my kids

I made $0.
But I kept my integrity.
I kept my boundaries.
I kept the things that money can't buy back.

There will be days you make money.
There will be days you don't.

But there should never be days where you sell parts of yourself you can't repurchase.

Know what's for sale. And what's not.

**CTA:**
When was the last time you chose integrity over income? How'd it feel?

## Post #18: "If You're Feeling Behind, Read This"

**Platform:** Instagram (Primary) | All platforms
**Post Type:** Carousel (5 slides)

### Visual Description
**Slide 1:** "IF YOU'RE FEELING BEHIND" - text over image of empty road stretching ahead
**Slide 2:** "You're not behind. There is no schedule. The timeline is made up."
**Slide 3:** "You're not late. You're on your path. It doesn't look like theirs because it's not supposed to."

"Atmospheric photograph of empty highway stretching to horizon at sunrise, warm orange and soft blue tones, open road symbolism, sense of journey and possibility, cinematic wide angle, 1:1 square format"

### Caption

**Hook:**
Everyone seems ahead of you. Here's what they're not telling you.

**Body:**
They're posting wins, not losses.
They're sharing arrivals, not journeys.
They're comparing their highlight reel to your behind-the-scenes.

And you're absorbing it like it's reality.

It's not.

Everyone's path looks different because everyone's path IS different.

There's no universal timeline.
No schedule you're supposed to be on.
No benchmark you're failing to hit.

The only race that exists is the one you create in your head.

Stop running someone else's race.
Start walking your own path.

You're not behind.
You're just comparing yourself to a fiction.

**AI Prompt for Gemini:**
"Intimate portrait of a man in moment of reflection, soft natural window lighting, slightly emotional expression, simple uncluttered background, authentic and vulnerable, warm muted tones, connection and depth, 9:16 vertical format"

### Caption

**Hook:**
Three weeks before my dad died, he gave me one piece of advice. I think about it every day.

**Body:**
He was in the hospital. I knew we didn't have long.

I asked him: "What do you wish you'd done differently?"

He said: "I wish I'd been less afraid. Of failure. Of looking stupid. Of what people thought."

Then he said something I'll never forget:

"The things I regret aren't the mistakes I made. They're the things I never tried because I was scared."

He wasn't talking about skydiving or traveling.

He was talking about conversations he never had.
Risks he never took.
Love he never expressed because it felt too vulnerable.

I carry that every day.

Not the fear of dying.
The fear of dying without trying.

Whatever you're afraid of - do it anyway.
Your future self will thank you.
Or you'll wish they had the chance to.

**CTA:**
What have you been avoiding because of fear? This is your permission to try.

## Post #20: "You Don't Need Motivation. You Need This Instead."

**Platform:** TikTok/Instagram (Primary)
**Post Type:** Video (45 seconds)

### Visual Description
**Style:** Direct to camera, simple setup, confident delivery
**Mood:** Practical, no-nonsense, helpful
**Text Overlay:** "MOTIVATION" gets X'd out, replaced with answer
**Aspect Ratio:** 9:16

**AI Prompt for Gemini:**
"Clean portrait of confident speaker, direct eye contact, simple professional background, natural lighting, casual but put-together appearance, trustworthy and knowledgeable expression, 9:16 vertical format"

### Caption

**Hook:**
You don't need motivation. Stop looking for it.

**Body:**
Motivation is a feeling.
Feelings come and go.
You can't build a life on something that comes and goes.

What you need instead: **Systems.**

Here's the truth:
→ Motivated people don't achieve more
→ Disciplined people with systems do

I don't wait to feel like working out.
I have a time. I go at that time. Feeling doesn't enter the conversation.

I don't wait for inspiration to create.
I have blocks in my calendar. I create during those blocks. Period.

Motivation is nice when it shows up.
But systems work whether motivation shows up or not.

Stop waiting to feel like it.
Start building systems that don't require feelings.

**CTA:**
What's one system that keeps you moving even when you don't feel like it?

#motivation #discipline #systems #habits #productivity #mindset #noexcuses #personaldevelopment #consistency #dothework

## Post #21: "The Text I Send Myself Every Sunday"

**Mood:** Intimate, practical, behind-the-scenes
**Text Overlay:** The actual text message
**Aspect Ratio:** 4:5

**AI Prompt for Gemini:**
"Realistic smartphone screenshot mockup showing a text message conversation with self, clean iOS-style interface, simple message text visible, soft lighting on phone screen, intimate and relatable aesthetic, 4:5 aspect ratio"

### Caption

**Hook:**
Every Sunday at 6pm, I send myself this text.

**Body:**
The message says:

"What are the 3 things that, if you do them this week, you'll feel proud of yourself on Friday?"

Not 10 things. Not a massive to-do list.
3 things.

Then I actually schedule them.
Not "sometime this week."
Actual time blocks. On the calendar.

Why does this work?

Because most weeks, we do a lot and accomplish little.
We're busy, not productive.
We check boxes, but the important things slide.

This text forces me to decide what matters BEFORE the chaos of the week takes over.

Try it. This Sunday. 6pm.
Ask yourself what 3 things would make you proud.
Then put them on the calendar.

Watch what happens to your week.

**CTA:**
What are YOUR 3 things for this week? Drop them below - makes them real.

## Post #22: "Controversial Take: Work-Life Balance is a Scam"

**Platform:** LinkedIn (Primary) | TikTok/Instagram (Secondary)
**Post Type:** Text/Video

### Visual Description
**Style:** If video - direct to camera with conviction. If image - bold text on contrasting background.
**Mood:** Provocative, controversial, thought-leading
**Text Overlay:** "WORK-LIFE BALANCE" crossed out
**Aspect Ratio:** 1:1 for LinkedIn, 9:16 for video

**AI Prompt for Gemini:**
"Bold typographic design with text 'WORK-LIFE BALANCE' prominently displayed with a red X through it, clean modern design, charcoal background, fire orange X mark, professional but provocative aesthetic, 1:1 square format"

### Caption

**Hook:**
Controversial take: Work-life balance is a scam. And chasing it is making you miserable.

**Body:**
Balance implies 50/50.
Equal weight. Equal time. Every day.

That's not how life works.
That's not how success works.
That's not how anything meaningful gets built.

What actually works? **Work-life integration.**

Some weeks are 70/30 toward work.
Product launch. Crunch time. Growth season.

Some weeks are 70/30 toward life.
Family needs. Recovery. Presence required.

Trying to hit perfect balance every single day is a recipe for feeling like you're failing at everything.

Instead: Know what season you're in.
Give that season what it needs.
And don't apologize for the imbalance.

A masterpiece isn't painted with perfect balance.
Neither is a life.

"Bold graphic design with text '$100K' in white on dark background, red 'GHOSTED' stamp overlay at an angle, dramatic and attention-grabbing, clean modern design, 1:1 square format"

### Caption

**Hook:**
I walked away from a $100K contract. And I'd do it again tomorrow.

**Body:**
The client was high-paying. High-demanding. And high-toxic.

Every call left me drained.
My team dreaded working with them.
The money was good, but we were paying in other ways.

So I ended it. Politely. Professionally. But firmly.

Everyone thought I was crazy.

"You're turning down SIX FIGURES?"
"In this economy?"
"What's wrong with you?"

Here's what they didn't see:

Within 3 months, we replaced that revenue with two clients who were actually great to work with.

And more importantly:
My team was happy again.
I was happy again.
The work was good again.

Some money isn't worth what it costs.

Know your price - and I don't mean dollars.

Have you ever walked away from money that wasn't worth it? What happened?

### Caption

**Hook:**
There's one question that, when I started asking it daily, changed everything.

**Body:**
"What would the person I want to become do right now?"

Not tomorrow. Not eventually. Right now.

Want to be healthier? What would that person eat for breakfast?
Want to be wealthier? What would that person do with this hour?
Want to be happier? What would that person focus on today?

You don't become someone new and THEN start acting differently.

You start acting differently and that's HOW you become someone new.

The gap between who you are and who you want to be?

It closes one choice at a time.

This choice. Right now. That's where transformation lives.

What would the person you want to become do in the next 60 seconds?

Go do that.
