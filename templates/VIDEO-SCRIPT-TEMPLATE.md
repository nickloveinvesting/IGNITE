- Cost per view (if running as ad)
- Conversion rate (view to lead)

### Optimize Based On
- If drop-off at hook: Test new opening
- If drop-off at 30s: Shorten or make more engaging
- If high views, low clicks: Strengthen CTA
- If low completion rate: Cut length or add more value

## Batch Production Tips

When creating videos for multiple magnets:

1. **Record all talking head portions same day**
   - Same outfit, lighting, setup
   - Record all 10 scripts in 2-3 hours

2. **Record all screen recordings separately**
   - Batch by magnet type
   - Use consistent on-screen styling

3. **Edit in assembly line fashion**
   - Cut all rough edits first
   - Add music to all
   - Add captions to all
   - Add graphics to all
   - Final review and export all

**Time Savings:** Batch = 10 hours total vs. Sequential = 20+ hours
