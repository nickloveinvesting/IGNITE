# Research Framework

Multi-agent research methodology integrated into all lead magnet prompts.

---

## Overview

Each IGNITE lead magnet prompt includes a sophisticated research component that simulates 3 specialized AI agents conducting parallel research. This ensures every generated artifact is informed by:

1. Competitive intelligence
2. Audience psychology
3. Platform optimization best practices

## Research Integration Process

### Phase 1: Pre-Generation Research (Built into Prompts)

Each lead magnet prompt instructs Claude to:

1. **Activate 3 research agents simultaneously**
2. **Conduct parallel research** across competitive, audience, and platform domains
3. **Synthesize findings** before generating artifacts
4. **Apply insights** to landing page, emails, ads, video script, PDF specs

### Phase 2: Research-Informed Generation

Research findings directly influence:

**Landing Page:**
- Headlines use competitive analysis + audience triggers
- Structure follows platform best practices
- CTAs optimized based on psychology research

**Email Sequences:**
- Timing based on platform optimization research
- Language based on audience psychology research
- Offer positioning based on competitive intelligence

**Facebook Ads:**
- Creative direction based on platform research
- Copy hooks based on audience triggers
- Targeting based on psychographic mapping

**Video Script:**
- Opening hook based on audience pain points
- Structure based on competitive analysis
- CTA based on platform optimization

**PDF Specs:**
- Design principles from platform research
- Content structure from audience psychology
- Engagement elements from competitive analysis

## Using Research for Prompts #11-20

When creating new lead magnet prompts:

### Step 1: Define Research Scope

```markdown
## RESEARCH PHASE

Simulate 3 specialized research agents:

**Agent 1: Competitive Intelligence**
Research: [specific competitors relevant to this magnet]
Focus: [what specifically to analyze]

**Agent 2: Audience Psychology**
Research: [specific segment of W2/1099/Entrepreneur]
Focus: [specific pain points and triggers for this magnet]

**Agent 3: Platform Optimization**
Research: [specific platforms for this magnet type]
Focus: [technical and conversion optimization]
```

### Step 2: Provide Search Queries

```markdown
Execute these web searches:
1. "[specific competitive query]"
2. "[specific audience query]"
3. "[specific platform query]"
```

### Step 3: Instruct Synthesis

```markdown
Synthesize research findings into:
- Top 3 competitive differentiators to emphasize
- Top 3 audience triggers to leverage
- Top 3 platform optimizations to implement
```

### Step 4: Apply to Artifacts

```markdown
Use research findings to inform:
- Landing page headline (audience trigger + competitive differentiator)
- Email sequence tone (audience psychology)
- Ad creative direction (platform optimization + competitive analysis)
- PDF structure (all 3 agents' findings)
```

---

## Research Documentation

After generating each magnet, document:

### Competitive Insights
- Which competitor strategies were most influential?

- What gaps were identified?

### Audience Insights
- Which pain points resonated most?
- What objections needed addressing?
- What language converted best?

## Research-Driven Optimization

Use research findings to optimize launched magnets:

### Low Conversion? Check:
- **Competitive:** Are competitors using different formats?
- **Audience:** Are we addressing the right pain points?
- **Platform:** Are we following current best practices?

### High Unsubscribe Rate? Check:
- **Audience:** Is our tone misaligned with segment?
- **Platform:** Are we emailing too frequently?
- **Competitive:** Are competitors setting different expectations?

### Low Ad CTR? Check:
- **Platform:** Are we following Facebook's latest creative guidance?
- **Audience:** Are we using the right psychological triggers?
