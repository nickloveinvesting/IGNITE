## Voice: Toby Potter Style

### Core Characteristics

#### 1. Direct
- Get to the point immediately
- No preamble or throat-clearing
- First sentence delivers value

**Example:**
❌ "In today's complex business environment, many individuals find themselves contemplating..."
✅ "You hate your job. Let's fix that."

---

#### 2. Authoritative
- Speak with conviction
- No hedging or qualification
- Make definitive statements

**Example:**
❌ "Studies suggest that goal-setting might be helpful..."
✅ "Goals without execution are fantasies. Here's how to execute."

---

#### 3. Action-Oriented
- Every statement points to action
- Focus on "what to do" not "what to know"
- Imperative verbs

**Example:**

---

#### 4. No-Nonsense
- Call out excuses
- Demand responsibility

---

#### 5. Empowering
- Build people up while pushing forward
- Acknowledge difficulty but emphasize capability
- Confidence-building through challenge

**Example:**
❌ "This will be easy and comfortable..."
✅ "This won't be easy. But you're capable of hard things. That's why you're here."

---

### What to AVOID

**Corporate Jargon:**
❌ "Leverage synergies to optimize outcomes"
✅ "Use what works. Stop what doesn't."

**Passive Voice:**

✅ "Do this:"

**Excessive Politeness:**
❌ "If you don't mind, could you perhaps..."
✅ "Do this next:"

**Academic Tone:**

✅ "People who do this succeed more. Data proves it."

## Tone Variations by Context

### Landing Pages
**Tone:** Bold, urgent, conversion-focused

**Characteristics:**
- Immediate value proposition
- Clear problem/solution
- Strong CTAs
- Benefit-driven copy

**Example:**
```
You're One Decision Away From Everything You Want

```

---

### Email Sequences
**Tone:** Direct but supportive, accountability-driven

**Characteristics:**
- Personal ("you" language)
- Supportive but firm
- Progress-focused
- Action-oriented closings

**Example:**
```
Subject: Did you complete your ledger?

You downloaded it. That's great.

But downloading isn't the same as doing. Transformation requires action,
not accumulation of PDFs.

Block 30 minutes today. Complete the ledger. Reply when you're done.

- Toby
```

---

### Facebook Ads
**Tone:** Attention-grabbing, provocative, scroll-stopping

**Characteristics:**
- Pattern interrupt

What's the cost of staying where you are?

[Lines for writing]
```

---

### Video Scripts
**Tone:** Conversational but intense, personal but firm

**Characteristics:**
- Spoken language (contractions, shorter sentences)

Look. I know why you're here.

You're stuck. You see other people winning, and you're wondering what
they know that you don't.

Here's the truth: They don't know more. They just decided to stop lying
to themselves.

[CONTINUE...]
