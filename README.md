## 📝 NOTES

**Psychology Applied**:
1. Cognitive dissonance (seeing cost creates urgency)
2. Loss aversion (quantifying losses motivates action)
3. Commitment devices (signing + dating creates accountability)
4. Repetition effect (28-day reading rewires subconscious)
5. Identity shift (pain-based → vision-based decision-making)

**Unique Mechanism**:
This isn't generic journaling. It's a diagnostic tool that forces brutal honesty about costs + commitment to new choices. Writing down + signing = psychological contract with self. Daily reading (28 days) = subconscious rewiring.

**IGNITE Bridge**:
The ledger is Day 1. IGNITE is the full 28-day program with community, coaching, and deeper transformation.
