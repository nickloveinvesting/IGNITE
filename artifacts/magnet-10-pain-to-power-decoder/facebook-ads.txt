═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
AD TESTING & OPTIMIZATION SCHEDULE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WEEK 1-2: BASELINE DATA COLLECTION
- Run all 3 variations simultaneously
- Equal budget ($100-150 each)
- Gather data (minimum 1,000 impressions per ad)
- Track CTR, CPC, CPL, conversion rate

WEEK 3: INITIAL OPTIMIZATION
- Identify best performer (highest CTR + lowest CPL)
- Double budget on winner
- Keep testing other variations at lower budget
- Create first round of variations (new headlines/images)

WEEK 4: SCALING
- Best performer gets 50% of budget
- Top 2 get remaining 50% split
- Pause worst performer (if CTR <2% or CPL >$6)
- Test new audiences (lookalikes, different interests)

WEEK 5-8: REFINEMENT
- Create new variations based on learnings
- Test different angles (benefits vs. transformation vs. speed)
- Test seasonal messaging (if applicable)
- Expand to new placements (Stories, Reels if not already)
- Test different formats (carousel, video if not already)

ONGOING:
- Refresh creative every 4-6 weeks (combat ad fatigue)
- Test new audiences quarterly
- Monitor frequency (keep <3 for best performance)
- A/B test continuously (always have 2+ variations running)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
BUDGET SCALING STRATEGY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PHASE 1: TESTING ($300-500/week)
- Goal: Find winning variation
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks
- Expected results: 100-150 leads/week at $2-4 CPL

PHASE 2: SCALING ($800-1,200/week)
- Goal: Scale winning variation
- Timeline: Weeks 5-8
- Expected results: 250-400 leads/week at $2.50-4.50 CPL

PHASE 3: OPTIMIZATION ($1,500-2,500/week)
- Goal: Maximize ROI
- Timeline: Weeks 9+
- Expected results: 500-800 leads/week at $2.50-5 CPL
- Monitor: ROAS (return on ad spend from IGNITE enrollments)

SCALING RULES:
- Never increase budget >20% at once (algorithm needs time to adjust)
- Wait 3-5 days between budget increases
- If CPL increases >30% after scaling, reduce budget
- Monitor relevance score (should stay >7)
- Refresh creative when frequency >3

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
