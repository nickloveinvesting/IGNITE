EMAIL BODY (Plain Text Format - Copy Below)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Hi [FirstName],

This is it.

Day 3.

You identified your pattern (Email 1).

You understood why it exists (Email 2).

Now we move to action.

Because understanding without action is just expensive entertainment.

---

HERE'S YOUR PERSONAL ESCAPE ROUTE:

Based on your pattern, here's what breaks it:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
YOUR ACTION PLAN (Based on Your Pattern)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IF YOU'RE THE UNMAPPED EXECUTOR:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

"Channel your action toward something specific."

YOUR ESCAPE ROUTE:

1. Define your 90-day vision (what are you building toward?)
2. Break it into 3 quarterly wins
3. This week: batch your action into focused sprints
4. Next week: measure your momentum

THIS WEEK'S ACTION:

Pick ONE project.

Commit to it for 90 days.

Let the rest go.

I'm serious. ONE.

Not "one primary and three secondary."

Just one.

Write it down: "For the next 90 days, I'm building ___________."

Everything else is a distraction.

YOUR WORKSHEET:

90-DAY FOCUS DECLARATION

1. My 90-day vision is: _________________________________

2. The ONE project I'm committing to: _________________________________

3. Three things I'm saying NO to (so I can say yes to this):
   - _________________________________
   - _________________________________
   - _________________________________

4. My weekly action (what I'll do every week for 90 days): _________________________________

5. How I'll measure momentum (my success metric): _________________________________

COMPLETE THIS WORKSHEET TODAY.

Put it somewhere you'll see it daily.

This is your escape route.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

IF YOU'RE THE ANALYSIS-LOCKED STRATEGIST:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

"Give yourself permission to start at 85% ready."

YOUR ESCAPE ROUTE:

1. Set a launch date (non-negotiable)
2. Launch at 85% ready (not 100%)
3. Get real feedback from real people (not more planning)
4. Iterate based on what you learn

THIS WEEK'S ACTION:

Choose one thing you're "planning."

Set a launch date in the next 7 days.

Lock it in.

Non-negotiable.

Launch at 85%. Not 100%.

Get it in front of real people. Get real feedback.

Then iterate.

YOUR WORKSHEET:

7-DAY LAUNCH COMMITMENT

1. What I've been planning (but not launching): _________________________________

2. My non-negotiable launch date: _____________ (within 7 days)

3. What "85% ready" looks like for this:
   - _________________________________
   - _________________________________
   - _________________________________

4. Who I'll get feedback from (3-5 real people): _________________________________

5. What I'll iterate after launch (based on feedback): _________________________________

6. My accountability: I'm telling _____________ about this launch date so I can't back out.

COMPLETE THIS WORKSHEET TODAY.

Set the launch date.

Tell someone.

Then launch.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

IF YOU'RE THE ISOLATED HIGH-ACHIEVER:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

"Build a mastermind. Get counsel. Don't do it alone."

YOUR ESCAPE ROUTE:

1. Identify 2-3 strategic partners (different expertise than you)
2. Commit to weekly sessions (accountability)
3. Share your real challenges
4. Get advice (and actually listen)

THIS WEEK'S ACTION:

Text 3 people.

Ask if they want to be part of a weekly accountability group.

Start next week.

It doesn't need to be formal. It doesn't need a name.

It just needs to happen.

Weekly. Consistent. Real challenges. Real feedback.

YOUR WORKSHEET:

MASTERMIND ACTIVATION PLAN

1. Three people I'll invite (peers, mentors, or strategic partners):
   - _________________________________
   - _________________________________
   - _________________________________

2. The text I'll send today:
   "Hey, I'm starting a weekly accountability group. 30-45 min. Share challenges, get feedback, stay sharp. Interested?"

3. Meeting cadence: Every _____________ at _____________ (time)

4. Format:
   - Each person shares: Current challenge + What they need
   - Group provides: Feedback, resources, accountability
   - Duration: 30-45 minutes

5. My first challenge I'll bring to the group: _________________________________

SEND THE TEXT TODAY.

Get 2-3 people committed.

Schedule the first session for next week.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

IF YOU'RE THE PERMISSION-SEEKER:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

"Grant yourself permission. You're already qualified."

YOUR ESCAPE ROUTE:

1. List your evidence of competence (past wins, results, feedback)
2. Realize YOU are the authority on your readiness
3. Move without waiting for external validation
4. Let success be your permission

THIS WEEK'S ACTION:

Write down 10 things you've accomplished.

Read them daily.

Feel the evidence.

That IS your permission.

Then make one move you've been waiting for permission to make.

YOUR WORKSHEET:

SELF-PERMISSION ACTIVATION

1. 10 things I've accomplished (evidence of my competence):
   1. _________________________________
   2. _________________________________
   3. _________________________________
   4. _________________________________
   5. _________________________________
   6. _________________________________
   7. _________________________________
   8. _________________________________
   9. _________________________________
   10. _________________________________

2. What I've been waiting for permission to do: _________________________________

3. Who I've been waiting to give me that permission: _________________________________

4. The truth: I don't need their permission because: _________________________________

5. The move I'm making this week (without waiting): _________________________________

6. My daily reminder: "I am qualified. The evidence is above. I grant myself permission."

COMPLETE THIS WORKSHEET TODAY.

Read your 10 accomplishments every morning for 7 days.

Then make the move.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

IF YOU'RE THE INHERITED-IDENTITY PRISONER:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

"Claim your own identity. Build your own vision."

YOUR ESCAPE ROUTE:

1. Get quiet. Ask: What do I actually want? (Remove all 'shoulds')
2. Name your core values
3. Envision your ideal day/year/life
4. Make one brave choice that's authentically you

THIS WEEK'S ACTION:

Spend 30 minutes alone.

Journal: What would my ideal life look like if I wasn't worried about disappointing anyone?

Then make one choice this week that's aligned with YOUR values (not theirs).

YOUR WORKSHEET:

IDENTITY RECLAMATION JOURNAL

1. Whose expectations am I currently living up to? _________________________________

2. What would I do differently if I wasn't worried about disappointing them?
   _________________________________
   _________________________________

3. My core values (what actually matters to me):
   - _________________________________
   - _________________________________
   - _________________________________

4. My ideal day looks like: _________________________________

5. My ideal year looks like: _________________________________

6. My ideal life looks like: _________________________________

7. One brave choice I'm making this week that's authentically mine: _________________________________

8. How this choice aligns with MY values (not theirs): _________________________________

SPEND 30 MINUTES ON THIS TODAY.

Be honest. Remove all "shoulds."

Then make the brave choice.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THAT'S YOUR FIRST STEP:

One small action.

This week.

Just one.

Don't skip it.

Don't wait.

Movement > Stuck.

Always.

---

AND HERE'S WHAT'S NEXT:

If you've done this work and you want to go deeper:

IGNITE is a 28-day program designed for exactly where you are.

Day 1: We go deeper on your pattern (like you just experienced)

Days 2-28: Daily lessons + practice + accountability + coaching

By day 28: You won't recognize yourself.

Not because you're different.

But because you're applying your natural strengths to YOUR vision.

---

HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:

IGNITE isn't another course you won't finish.

It's a 28-day intensive.

Daily lessons (10-15 min).

Weekly coaching (live calls).

Community accountability (other high-achievers breaking their patterns).

Personalized action plans (like the one you just got, but 28 of them).

And by day 28: You're unstuck.

---

WHO IT'S FOR:

High-achievers who are stuck.

People making good money but not breakthrough money.

Successful but unfulfilled.

Busy but not building.

If that's you, IGNITE is designed for this exact moment.

---

WHO IT'S NOT FOR:

People looking for motivation.

People who want theory without action.

People who aren't ready to commit 10-15 min/day for 28 days.

If that's you, this isn't for you. And that's okay.

---

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:

If you're ready, here's what to do:

→ Schedule a free 30-minute strategy call

We'll talk about:
- Your specific pattern
- Where you're stuck
- Whether IGNITE is right for you

This isn't a hard sell.

If we don't think IGNITE is right for you, we'll tell you.

But if you are ready, we want you in.

→ [BUTTON: Schedule Your Strategy Call]

---

OR:

If you're not ready for IGNITE, that's okay.

Use the action plan above.

Complete the worksheet.

Take the first step.

Whether you do IGNITE or not, do the action I outlined for your pattern.

This week.

Even if it's just 15 minutes.

Movement > Stuck.

Always.

---

Talk soon,

[Your Name]

P.S. The next IGNITE cohort starts [DATE].

We cap it at 50 people (so everyone gets personal attention).

If you're interested, schedule your call this week.

Spots fill fast.

For subscribers who COMPLETE SEQUENCE but DON'T CONVERT:
- Move to nurture sequence:
