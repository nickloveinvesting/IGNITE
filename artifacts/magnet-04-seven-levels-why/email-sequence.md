Hey [First Name],

Welcome! You just took the first step toward discovering something most people never find: your unshakable identity-level why.

Here's what you get today:

→ The 7-Levels-Deep Why Excavator (interactive worksheet) [DOWNLOAD LINK]
→ A 3-minute intro video explaining why this matters [WATCH NOW]
→ A 7-day coaching sequence to guide you through each level

First things first: Watch this 3-minute video.

[VIDEO EMBED OR THUMBNAIL WITH LINK]

It explains the science behind why surface motivation (money, status, achievement) leads to burnout—and why identity-level motivation creates unshakable clarity.

Then, download your worksheet here: [BIG BUTTON: Download The Excavator]

THE PROMISE:
If you complete all 7 levels (20-30 minutes of focused work), you'll discover:

✓ The real reason you're doing what you're doing (not the bullsh*t answer)
✓ A decision-making filter that eliminates second-guessing
✓ Motivation that doesn't fade when things get hard
✓ Crystal-clear alignment between your daily actions and deepest values

THE RESEARCH:
People who complete this exercise and create implementation intentions have a 91% follow-through rate—compared to 53% for those with general good intentions.

In other words: This isn't theory. This is transformation.

Over the next 7 days, I'll send you coaching emails to guide you through:
- Levels 1-3 (Quick Clarity) - Surface to emotions
- Levels 4-7 (Soul-Level Truth) - Identity to unshakable core
- Implementation Planning - Turn insight into action

But start today. Watch the video, then spend 20-30 minutes with the worksheet.

Your future self will thank you.

Let's go,
[Your Name]

P.S. The biggest mistake people make? Stopping at Level 1-2 (surface desires) and calling it done. The real breakthrough happens at Levels 5-7. Don't stop early.

**BEHAVIORAL TRIGGER (48 Hours Later):**

**IF PDF NOT OPENED:**

**Subject:** [First Name], you haven't opened your worksheet yet (here's why you should)

```
Hey [First Name],

I noticed you haven't downloaded the 7-Levels-Deep Why Excavator yet.

Real talk: I get it. Life is busy. You'll "get to it later."

But here's the thing...

Every day you operate from a shallow why is a day of wasted energy.

Research shows that surface motivation (what most people have) leads to:
- Burnout (it's unsustainable)
- Decision paralysis (no clear filter)
- Quiet dissatisfaction (achieving goals that don't fulfill you)

The 7-levels framework takes 20-30 minutes.
And it creates clarity that lasts a lifetime.

So here's my challenge: Block 30 minutes TODAY.

Download the worksheet: [LINK]
Watch the 3-min intro: [LINK]
Complete Levels 1-3 (just the first half)

You can finish the rest tomorrow.

But start today.

Because clarity doesn't come from thinking about doing the work—it comes from doing the work.

Let's go,
[Your Name]

P.S. I've watched thousands of people go through this exercise. The ones who complete it in the first 48 hours? They're the ones who experience transformation. The ones who "save it for later"? Most never do it. Which one will you be?

Hey [First Name],

Quick question: Why are you building what you're building?

If you said something like:
- "To make money"
- "To be successful"
- "To achieve financial freedom"
- "To provide for my family"

...your why is too shallow.

I know that sounds harsh. But hear me out.

Those answers are all Level 1 or Level 2 motivation—surface desires and practical benefits.

And here's what the research shows about surface motivation:

❌ It's unsustainable (motivation fades when things get hard)
❌ It creates burnout (external rewards never satisfy)
❌ It leads to achieving goals that leave you empty

But here's the good news:

You're one worksheet away from discovering your REAL why—the identity-level truth that makes you unstoppable.

THE 7-LEVELS BREAKDOWN:

Level 1: External Outcomes (money, status, achievement)
→ Most people stop here. Fragile motivation.

Level 2: Practical Benefits (what the outcome allows)
→ Still surface-level. Still unsustainable.

Level 3: Feelings & Experiences (desired emotional states)
→ Getting warmer, but emotions fluctuate.

Level 4: Identity & Self-Perception (who you become)
→ THIS is where breakthrough begins. Identity-based motivation is 2.8x more satisfying.

Level 5: Core Values (fundamental beliefs)
→ Values drive behavior across all life domains. Deep and stable.

Level 6: Life Meaning & Purpose (contribution beyond yourself)
→ Connected to ikigai (reason for living). Highly sustainable.

Level 7: Unshakable Identity-Core (deepest truth about who you are)
→ BEDROCK. The foundation that never shakes.

HERE'S THE TRUTH:

When you're operating from Level 1-2, every obstacle feels like a sign to quit.

When you're operating from Level 7, obstacles feel like proof that it matters.

Same obstacle. Completely different interpretation.

That's the power of deep why.

YOUR ASSIGNMENT:

If you haven't started the worksheet yet, do it today.

If you started but stopped at Level 3, KEEP GOING. The breakthrough is at Levels 5-7.

Tomorrow, I'll send you a walkthrough of Levels 1-3 to help you get started (or get unstuck).

But here's my challenge: Don't wait for tomorrow. Start today.

Block 20-30 minutes. Find a quiet space. Go deep.

You've spent years building from a shallow foundation. It's time to find bedrock.

Let's go,
[Your Name]

P.S. The most common feedback I get from this exercise? "I cried when I hit Level 7 because I finally understood what I've been searching for." That's not hyperbole. That's what happens when you reach truth.

## EMAIL #2: LEVELS 1-3 WALKTHROUGH (QUICK CLARITY)

**SUBJECT LINE VARIATIONS:**
- How to complete Levels 1-3 (the quick clarity section)
- [First Name], let's get you to Level 3 today (halfway there)
- The quick clarity breakthrough (Levels 1-3 walkthrough)

**EMAIL BODY:**

```
Hey [First Name],

Today we're going to get you through Levels 1-3 of the 7-Levels-Deep Why Excavator.

This is the "quick clarity" section—it takes about 10-15 minutes and gives you more insight than most people ever discover.

But it's NOT the final destination. (That's Levels 4-7, which we'll tackle in the next email.)

Let's break it down:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
LEVEL 1: EXTERNAL OUTCOMES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Start with a goal or desire. Something you want to achieve, change, or build.

Examples:
- "I want to grow my business to $1M/year"
- "I want to quit my job and work for myself"
- "I want to get in the best shape of my life"

Write it down in the worksheet: "I want to _______"

Then ask: WHY do I want this? What will it give me?

Your answer might be:
- "So I can make more money"
- "So I can have freedom"
- "So I can feel proud of myself"

Write that answer in Level 1.

COACHING TIP: Don't overthink it. First answer is usually best.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
LEVEL 2: PRACTICAL BENEFITS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Now take your Level 1 answer and ask: "Why is THAT important to me?"

If your Level 1 was "So I can make more money," ask:
"Why is making more money important to me?"

Your Level 2 answer might be:
- "So I can afford a better house and provide for my family"
- "So I don't have to worry about bills"
- "So I can travel and experience life"

Write that in Level 2.

COACHING TIP: You're still in the practical zone. Keep going.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
LEVEL 3: FEELINGS & EXPERIENCES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Take your Level 2 answer and ask again: "Why is THAT important to me?"

This is where you start hitting emotions.

If your Level 2 was "So I can provide for my family," ask:
"Why is providing for my family important to me?"

Your Level 3 answer might be:
- "So I can feel like a good father/mother"
- "So I can feel secure and safe"
- "So I can feel like I'm enough"

Write that in Level 3.

COACHING TIP: You're getting closer to truth. Many people have mini-breakthroughs here. But we're not done yet.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PAUSE HERE.

You've just completed the "quick clarity" section. You now understand:
✓ What you want (Level 1)
✓ What it gives you practically (Level 2)
✓ How you want to feel (Level 3)

This alone puts you ahead of 90% of people.

But here's the truth: Levels 1-3 are still surface motivation.

Feelings fluctuate. Circumstances change. Surface motivation fades.

The REAL breakthrough happens at Levels 4-7:
- Identity (who you are)
- Values (what you stand for)
- Purpose (why you exist)
- Unshakable Core (your deepest truth)

In 2 days, I'll send you the walkthrough for Levels 4-7.

But if you're feeling it right now, don't wait. Keep going.

Ask "Why is THAT important?" 4 more times.

By the time you hit Level 7, you'll have discovered something most people never find: unshakable clarity about who you are.

Let's go,
[Your Name]

P.S. The pattern you're looking for: When you read your answer and feel it in your chest (not just your head), you're getting close to truth. Keep going until you hit bedrock.

## EMAIL #3: LEVELS 4-7 DEEP DIVE (SOUL-LEVEL TRUTH)
**Send:** Day 5-7 (depending on engagement)
**Subject Line:** Levels 4-7: Where the real breakthrough happens

---

**SUBJECT LINE VARIATIONS:**
- Levels 4-7: Where the real breakthrough happens
- [First Name], this is where surface becomes soul-level
- The identity-core discovery (Levels 4-7 walkthrough)

**EMAIL BODY:**

```
Hey [First Name],

This is it. The deep work.

If you completed Levels 1-3, you have clarity about what you want, what it gives you, and how you want to feel.

But now we go deeper.

Levels 4-7 move you from surface motivation (fragile, unsustainable) to identity-level motivation (unshakable, unstoppable).

This is where the research gets interesting:

→ Identity-based motivation creates 2.8x higher satisfaction
→ 91% follow-through when connected to identity vs. 53% with surface goals
→ Significant protection against burnout

In other words: This is where transformation happens.

Let's break it down.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
LEVEL 4: IDENTITY & SELF-PERCEPTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Take your Level 3 answer (feelings/experiences) and ask:

"Who do I BECOME when I have this? What does this say about who I am?"

If your Level 3 was "So I can feel like I'm enough," ask:
"What does feeling 'enough' say about who I am?"

Your Level 4 answer might be:
- "I am someone who proves their worth through achievement"
- "I am a provider and protector"
- "I am someone who refuses to settle"

THIS IS IMPORTANT: You're shifting from "I want to feel..." to "I am..."

That shift—from desire to identity—changes everything.

Why? Because identity drives action.

When something is identity-congruent ("this is who I am"), you act automatically. When it's just a want, you need willpower.

COACHING TIP: If your Level 4 answer starts with "I want to be..." try again. Level 4 is "I AM."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
LEVEL 5: CORE VALUES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Now ask: "What VALUES does this represent? What principles am I honoring?"

If your Level 4 was "I am a provider and protector," ask:
"What values does being a provider/protector represent?"

Your Level 5 answer might be:
- "Family, security, responsibility, and legacy"
- "Integrity, commitment, and service"
- "Strength, reliability, and contribution"

Values are the bridge between identity and purpose.

They're deeply ingrained, stable across time, and drive behavior in all life domains (not just one area).

COACHING TIP: Common core values include family, freedom, growth, contribution, integrity, adventure, connection, authenticity, impact, service, excellence, creativity, independence, legacy. Use these to help clarify.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
LEVEL 6: LIFE MEANING & PURPOSE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Ask: "How does this connect to my life's PURPOSE? What impact does this have beyond me?"

If your Level 5 was "Family, security, and legacy," ask:
"Why do these values matter in the bigger picture of my life?"

Your Level 6 answer might be:
- "To break generational patterns and create a legacy of stability"
- "To model what's possible so my kids aim higher"
- "To contribute to a world where families thrive, not just survive"

Purpose is about contribution beyond yourself.

Research on ikigai (Japanese concept of purpose) shows that people with strong purpose live longer, experience less burnout, and report higher life satisfaction.

This isn't woo-woo. This is measurable.

COACHING TIP: Purpose is the intersection of what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what provides meaning.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
LEVEL 7: UNSHAKABLE IDENTITY-CORE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Final question: "At my very core, who am I in relation to this? What is the deepest truth this reveals?"

If your Level 6 was "To break generational patterns and create a legacy of stability," ask:
"What does this reveal about who I fundamentally am?"

Your Level 7 answer might be:
- "At my core, I am a builder and a breaker of chains—I create what didn't exist and end what shouldn't continue"
- "I am a protector of potential—I guard and grow what matters"
- "I am a bridge—I transform what I was given into what's needed"

THIS IS BEDROCK.

When you read your Level 7 answer, you should feel it in your bones.

It should feel:
✓ Unshakably true
✓ Bigger than any single goal
✓ Consistent across all areas of your life
✓ Emotional (many people cry at Level 7)

THE TRUTH TEST:

Read your Level 7 answer out loud.

Ask yourself:
1. Does this feel unshakably true?
2. When I think about obstacles, does this make them feel important (not impossible)?
3. Would I act on this even without external reward?
4. Is this consistent with who I am across work, relationships, health, and personal growth?

If you answered YES to all 4, you've arrived. You've discovered your identity-core.

If not, go one more level deeper.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:

You now have something most people never find: unshakable clarity.

But clarity without action is just philosophy.

In 3 days, I'll send you the implementation framework—how to turn this insight into daily action with 91% follow-through.

Until then, sit with your Level 7 answer. Let it sink in.

This is who you are. This is your foundation. Build on it.

Let's go,
[Your Name]

P.S. If you haven't completed all 7 levels yet, block 20 minutes TODAY. Don't wait. This is the most important work you can do.

## EMAIL #4: IMPLEMENTATION BRIDGE / THREE PATHS
**Send:** Day 10
**Subject Line:** You have clarity. Now what? (3 paths forward)

---

**SUBJECT LINE VARIATIONS:**
- You have clarity. Now what? (3 paths forward)
- [First Name], how to turn insight into action (the 91% formula)
- From discovery to implementation (your next step)

---

**EMAIL BODY:**

```
Hey [First Name],

Let's talk about the gap between KNOWING and DOING.

If you completed the 7-Levels-Deep Why Excavator, you now have clarity most people never find.

You know:
✓ Your identity-core (Level 7)
✓ Your core values (Level 5)
✓ Your life purpose (Level 6)

That's powerful.

But here's the truth: 47% of people who gain clarity never implement it.

They have the insight. They feel the breakthrough. Then life happens, and nothing changes.

I don't want that for you.

So today, I'm going to give you the implementation framework—and then present you with 3 paths forward.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
THE 91% FORMULA: IMPLEMENTATION INTENTIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Research shows that 91% of people who create specific implementation intentions (when/where/how) follow through—compared to only 53% with general good intentions.

In other words: Specificity doubles your success rate.

Here's the formula:

"I will [ACTION] on [DAY] at [TIME] in/at [PLACE]."

Example:
❌ "I'm going to honor my value of family more."
✅ "I will have a phone-free dinner with my family every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 6:30pm at our dining table."

See the difference?

The second one is identity-congruent action with when/where/how specificity.

That's what gets 91% follow-through.

YOUR ASSIGNMENT:

Go back to your worksheet (Part 5: Implementation Planning).

1. Write your 3 core values (from Level 5)
2. For each value, list 3 daily actions that honor it
3. Choose ONE action and make it specific (when/where/how)
4. Tell someone about your commitment (accountability)

Do this, and you'll be in the 91%.

Skip this, and you'll be in the 53%.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
THE DECISION FILTER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Your Level 7 identity-core is now your decision-making filter.

Every opportunity, commitment, or choice you face, ask:

"Does this honor my Level 7 identity?"

→ If YES: Pursue it
→ If NO: Decline it

It's that simple.

No more second-guessing. No more paralysis.

You have a filter. Use it.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
THREE PATHS FORWARD
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Here's where you are now:

✓ You completed the 7-Levels-Deep Why Excavator
✓ You discovered your identity-core
✓ You have the implementation framework

Now you have 3 choices:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PATH 1: SELF-IMPLEMENTATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You take what you learned and implement it yourself.

You use:
- The decision filter (Level 7 identity)
- The daily actions (values-aligned behavior)
- The 91% formula (implementation intentions)

You revisit the worksheet every 90 days to deepen clarity.

This works for self-motivated, disciplined individuals who thrive independently.

If this is you: GO. Build your values-aligned life. I'm rooting for you.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PATH 2: CONTINUED LEARNING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You stay on this email list and receive monthly content on:
- Living from identity-level motivation
- Values-aligned decision-making
- Building businesses/careers that honor your why
- Case studies from others who've done the work

This is the nurture path. You implement on your own but get continued support and inspiration.

No action needed—you're already subscribed.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PATH 3: PERSONALIZED COACHING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You want help integrating your Level 7 why into every area of your life.

You want:
- A business/career aligned with your identity-core
- Systems that honor your values daily (not just intentions)
- Accountability for implementation
- Personalized guidance for your specific situation

This is the transformation path.

We work together 1-on-1 (or in a small group) to build a life where your daily actions match your deepest truth.

If this is you: Book a free clarity call here [LINK]

We'll discuss where you are, where you want to be, and whether coaching is the right fit.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ALL THREE PATHS ARE VALID.

The only wrong choice is doing nothing.

You didn't go 7 levels deep just to stay the same.

You have clarity. Now build on it.

Let's go,
[Your Name]

P.S. Over the next few months, I'll check in periodically to see how you're progressing. But today, make ONE implementation decision. Choose your path. Take one action. Start building.

[PATH 1: Implement solo - you've got this]
[PATH 2: Stay subscribed - you're already set]

## EMAIL #5: FIRST CHECK-IN / WINS CELEBRATION
**Send:** Day 14
**Subject Line:** 2-week check-in: How's your Level 7 clarity holding up?

---

**EMAIL BODY:**

```
Hey [First Name],

It's been 2 weeks since you discovered your Level 7 identity-core.

Quick check-in: How's it going?

Have you:
✓ Made decisions using your identity filter?
✓ Implemented your daily actions (values-aligned behavior)?
✓ Noticed a shift in how you show up?

If YES: That's transformation in action. Keep going.

If NOT YET: No judgment. Let's get you unstuck.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
THE 2-WEEK REALITY CHECK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Here's what I see happen at the 2-week mark:

**GROUP 1: The Implementers (20%)**
These people completed the worksheet, made implementation intentions, and have been living from their Level 7 why daily. They're experiencing clarity, confidence, and alignment.

**GROUP 2: The In-Progress (50%)**
These people completed the worksheet, felt the breakthrough, but haven't fully integrated it yet. They know their why but struggle with daily implementation.

**GROUP 3: The Not-Yet-Started (30%)**
These people downloaded the worksheet but haven't completed it yet. Life got busy.

Which group are you in?

IF YOU'RE IN GROUP 1 (Implementers):

CELEBRATE. You're in the top 20%.

Here's what to focus on now:
- Track your wins (write down aligned decisions you've made)
- Refine your daily actions (what's working? what's not?)
- Share your Level 7 with someone close to you (speaking it creates accountability)

IF YOU'RE IN GROUP 2 (In-Progress):

You have clarity but need implementation support.

Here's the unlock: Pick ONE daily action that honors your core values.

Just one.

Example:
- Value = Family → Action = Phone-free dinner 3x/week
- Value = Growth → Action = 15-min morning reading
- Value = Contribution → Action = One act of service daily

Make it specific (when/where/how).
Do it for 30 days.

That's how clarity becomes transformation.

IF YOU'RE IN GROUP 3 (Not-Yet-Started):

No shame. But real talk: If you don't complete the worksheet in the next 7 days, you probably never will.

Block 30 minutes THIS WEEK.

Do Levels 1-3 today (15 minutes).
Do Levels 4-7 tomorrow (15 minutes).

Your future self is waiting.

## EMAIL #6: VALUES IN ACTION / DECISION FILTER
**Send:** Day 30
**Subject Line:** 30 days in: The decision that changed everything

---

**EMAIL BODY:**

```
Hey [First Name],

It's been 30 days since you discovered your Level 7 identity-core.

I want to talk about decisions.

Because here's the truth: Your life is the sum of your decisions.

Where you are today = the result of 1,000 small choices.
Where you'll be in 1 year = the result of the choices you make now.

And most people make decisions from Level 1-2 motivation (surface desires).

They ask:
- "Will this make me money?"
- "Will this make me look good?"
- "Will this be easy?"

But YOU have something different now: a Level 7 decision filter.

You can ask:
- "Does this honor who I am at my core?"
- "Is this aligned with my deepest values?"
- "Will this move me toward or away from my purpose?"

That's the difference between surface and soul-level clarity.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
THE DECISION THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Let me share a story.

A few years ago, I was offered a high-paying opportunity.

Surface level (Level 1-2):
✓ Great money
✓ Impressive title
✓ External validation

But when I ran it through my Level 7 filter ("Am I a builder of what matters or a chaser of what looks good?"), the answer was clear:

This was misaligned.

It looked good on paper but violated my core values (autonomy, impact, alignment).

I said no.

And that "no" created space for the "yes" that actually mattered.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
YOUR ASSIGNMENT: THE ALIGNMENT AUDIT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Pull out your worksheet (or your Level 7 statement if you have it saved).

Ask yourself:

1. What's one decision I've made in the past 30 days that HONORED my Level 7 identity?

Write it down. Celebrate it.

2. What's one commitment I currently have that VIOLATES my core values?

Write it down. Make a plan to exit it.

3. What's one opportunity I'm currently considering?

Run it through the filter:
- Does this honor my Level 7 identity? (YES/NO)
- Does this align with my core values? (YES/NO)
- Will this move me toward my purpose? (YES/NO)

If you get 3 YES answers: Pursue it.
If you get 2 or fewer: Decline it.

It's that simple.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
THE COMPOUND EFFECT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

One aligned decision doesn't change your life.

But 100 aligned decisions? That's transformation.

Every time you choose based on your Level 7 identity (not surface desires), you:
✓ Strengthen your clarity
✓ Build identity-congruent momentum
✓ Create a values-aligned life

Every time you choose based on surface motivation, you:
❌ Weaken your foundation
❌ Create cognitive dissonance (saying one thing, doing another)
❌ Move further from fulfillment

Your Level 7 why is your compass.

Use it.

Let's go,
[Your Name]

P.S. In 30 days, I'll check in again. Between now and then, track your aligned decisions. See if you can make 30 values-aligned choices in 30 days. That's the transformation game.

```

Before: ☐ Low ☐ Medium ☐ High
Now: ☐ Low ☐ Medium ☐ High

**CLARITY ABOUT PURPOSE:**
Before: ☐ Unclear ☐ Somewhat Clear ☐ Crystal Clear
Now: ☐ Unclear ☐ Somewhat Clear ☐ Crystal Clear

What do you notice?

If you see improvement: THAT'S the power of identity-level clarity.

If you DON'T see improvement: We need to course-correct.

COURSE CORRECTION: THE 3 GAPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If you're NOT seeing transformation, it's usually one of 3 gaps:

**GAP 1: CLARITY GAP**
You completed the worksheet but didn't reach true Level 7 (identity-core).

FIX: Revisit the exercise. Go one level deeper. The truth test is: Does your Level 7 answer feel unshakably true and make you emotional?

**GAP 2: IMPLEMENTATION GAP**
You have clarity but haven't created specific daily actions.

FIX: Use the 91% formula. Pick ONE value. Create ONE daily action. Make it specific (when/where/how). Do it for 30 days.

**GAP 3: ACCOUNTABILITY GAP**
You know what to do but lack structure or support to follow through.

FIX: Get accountability. Tell someone your Level 7 why. Report weekly progress. Or book a coaching call and let's build a system. [LINK]

Which gap applies to you?

Fix it this week.

## EMAIL #8: MASTERY CHECK-IN / COACHING INVITATION
**Send:** Day 90
**Subject Line:** 90 days of clarity: What's next?

---

**EMAIL BODY:**

```
Hey [First Name],

90 days.

3 months since you discovered your Level 7 identity-core.

This is the mastery check-in.

By now, one of three things has happened:

**OUTCOME 1: TRANSFORMATION**
You've integrated your Level 7 why into your daily life. You make decisions faster. You have clarity. You're building a values-aligned life. You're in the top 10%.

**OUTCOME 2: PROGRESS**
You've made some changes but haven't fully integrated your why yet. You're moving in the right direction but need more support, structure, or accountability.

**OUTCOME 3: STAGNATION**
Life got busy. You completed the worksheet but didn't implement. You have the insight but not the transformation.

Be honest: Which outcome describes you?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
IF YOU'RE IN OUTCOME 1 (TRANSFORMATION):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Congratulations. You did the work.

Here's what's next:

**1. DEEPEN YOUR CLARITY**

Revisit the 7-levels exercise. As you grow, your answers evolve.

Ask the same questions again. See what's changed.

Often, Level 7 becomes clearer, sharper, more precise the second time.

**2. EXPAND YOUR ALIGNMENT**

Look at the 4 life domains (work, relationships, personal growth, health).

Which domain is MOST aligned with your Level 7 why?
Which domain is LEAST aligned?

Focus on closing the gap in the least-aligned domain.

**3. LEAD WITH YOUR WHY**

You have something most people don't: unshakable clarity.

Share it. Teach it. Lead with it.

Your Level 7 why is your competitive advantage.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
IF YOU'RE IN OUTCOME 2 (PROGRESS):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You're on the right track, but you need support.

Here's the truth: Transformation doesn't happen in isolation.

The people who go furthest are the ones who get:
- Accountability (someone to report progress to)
- Structure (systems that make aligned action automatic)
- Personalized guidance (specific feedback for their situation)

That's what coaching provides.

If you want to accelerate from "progress" to "transformation," let's talk.

Book a free clarity call: [LINK]

We'll create a personalized plan to integrate your Level 7 why into every area of life.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
IF YOU'RE IN OUTCOME 3 (STAGNATION):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Real talk: If nothing has changed in 90 days, nothing will change in the next 90 days unless you change your approach.

You have two options:

**OPTION 1: Recommit**

Block 1 hour this week.
Revisit the worksheet.
Complete ALL 7 levels (don't stop early).
Create ONE implementation intention (when/where/how).
Do it for 30 days.

**OPTION 2: Get Support**

If you can't do it alone, don't.

Book a coaching call. Let's build the structure you need.

[BOOK HERE]

But here's the thing: You don't get transformation by accident.

You have to choose it. And then build it.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
THE 90-DAY QUESTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Here's the question I want you to sit with:

"Am I living from my Level 7 identity-core, or am I still chasing Level 1-2 surface desires?"

If you're living from Level 7: Keep going. You're building something rare.

If you're still at Level 1-2: It's time to go deeper.

You didn't come this far to stay the same.

Let's go,
[Your Name]

P.S. This is the final email in the 7-Levels-Deep Why sequence. From here, you'll receive monthly content on values-aligned living, decision-making, and purpose-driven work. But if you want personalized support, book a call. This is your moment.

# BEHAVIORAL TRIGGER SEQUENCES

## TRIGGER: PDF OPENED, NOT COMPLETED (Day 5)

**Subject:** [First Name], you started the worksheet but didn't finish (here's why that matters)

```
Hey [First Name],

I noticed you opened the 7-Levels-Deep Why worksheet but didn't complete it.

Real talk: I get it.

The first few levels feel manageable. But somewhere around Level 3-4, it gets uncomfortable.

You start hitting real truth. And truth can be scary.

But here's the thing: The discomfort is the breakthrough.

Most people stop right before the transformation.

They get to Level 3 (feelings), feel a little clarity, and call it done.

But the REAL why—the unshakable identity-core—is at Level 7.

And you can't get there without going through the discomfort.

So here's my challenge:

Block 15 minutes today. Finish the worksheet.

If you stopped at Level 3, ask "Why is THAT important?" 4 more times.

Don't stop until you hit something that feels unshakably true.

You'll know it when you feel it.

Let's go,
[Your Name]

P.S. The people who complete all 7 levels? They're the ones who experience transformation. The ones who stop early? They stay stuck. Which one will you be?

[FINISH YOUR WORKSHEET NOW]
```

## TRIGGER: NO ENGAGEMENT (Day 7)

**Subject:** [First Name], you haven't started yet (last chance)

```
Hey [First Name],

7 days ago, you requested the 7-Levels-Deep Why Excavator.

But you haven't opened it yet.

I'm going to be direct: If you don't do it in the next 48 hours, you probably never will.

I know that sounds harsh. But it's true.

The research shows that people who complete transformational exercises in the first week implement them. People who "save it for later" rarely do.

So here's my final push:

This worksheet takes 20-30 minutes.

And it could change the next 20-30 YEARS of your life.

You're one focused session away from discovering:
✓ Your unshakable why
✓ Crystal-clear decision-making
✓ Motivation that doesn't fade
✓ Values-aligned direction

Or... you can stay where you are.

Chasing surface goals. Second-guessing decisions. Wondering if you're building the right life.

Your choice.

If you're ready: [DOWNLOAD THE WORKSHEET]

If you're not: Unsubscribe below. No hard feelings.

But don't stay in the middle. That's where nothing changes.

Let's go,
[Your Name]

P.S. I'll send one more email in 3 days. After that, if you haven't engaged, I'll assume this isn't for you and remove you from the sequence. Fair?
```

## TRIGGER: COMPLETED WORKSHEET, HIGH ENGAGEMENT (Day 12)

**Subject:** [First Name], you completed all 7 levels (you're in the top 10%)

```
Hey [First Name],

I see you.

You completed the entire 7-Levels-Deep Why worksheet.

You didn't stop at Level 1-2 (where most people quit).
You didn't skip the hard questions.
You went all the way to Level 7—your identity-core.

That puts you in the top 10% of people who start this exercise.

So first: Congratulations. You did the deep work.

Now here's the question: What are you going to BUILD with this clarity?

Because insight without implementation is just philosophy.

You have your Level 7 why. Your core values. Your purpose.

Now it's time to integrate it into:
- Your business/career
- Your relationships
- Your daily decisions
- Your long-term direction

That's where transformation happens.

I have 2 spots opening up for 1-on-1 coaching this month.

If you want personalized support to build a life fully aligned with your Level 7 identity, let's talk.

Book a free clarity call: [LINK]

We'll discuss where you are, where you want to be, and create a plan to close the gap.

You did the hard part (discovering your why). Let me help you with the next part (building from it).

Let's go,
[Your Name]

P.S. This invitation is only going to people who completed all 7 levels. You've proven you're serious. If you want support, I'm here.
