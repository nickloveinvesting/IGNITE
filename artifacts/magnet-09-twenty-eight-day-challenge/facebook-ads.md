### PRIMARY TEXT:

28 days.

That's how long it takes to see what you're actually capable of.

Not "think about it." Not "plan it." Not "get ready to start."

Actually do it.

Most people spend 10 years trading time for money, wondering when life gets better.

The answer: When you stop waiting and start transforming.

This isn't a motivational challenge. It's the full IGNITE methodology—delivered daily to your inbox for 28 days.

Day 1: You'll map your Pain & Vision Ledger (the tool that changes everything).

Days 2-28: One lesson per day from the complete IGNITE program.

By Day 28, you'll know:
→ Your exact stuck pattern (and how to break it)
→ Your deep "why" (7 levels deep, not surface BS)
→ Your daily discipline blueprint
→ Your 90-day transformation plan

No cost. No fluff. Just transformation.

4,500+ people are doing this challenge right now.

Question is: Are you in or are you out?

### PRIMARY TEXT:

4,500 people are doing this challenge right now.

And you're about to see exactly why.

It's not a "motivational email series." It's not daily affirmations or feel-good quotes.

It's the complete IGNITE transformation framework—delivered in 28 daily lessons.

Day 1 alone changes how people see their lives. (We get replies every day from people saying "I needed this.")

But here's what makes it different:

**Everyone starts on the same day.**

So you're not doing this alone. You're part of a cohort. A community. A movement.

People are posting their Day 7 breakthroughs. Their Day 14 realizations. Their Day 28 transformations.

And they're enrolling in the full IGNITE program at rates we've never seen before.

Because when you experience the methodology for 28 days—you see what's possible.

Most people wait. Most people "think about it." Most people stay stuck.

But 4,500+ are already in.

**The question: Are you joining them?**

Free to start. Daily lessons. Complete transformation framework.

No cost. No catch. No excuses.

## CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE RECOMMENDATIONS

### Testing Strategy

**Phase 1: Initial Testing (Days 1-7)**
- Run all 3 variations simultaneously
- Budget: $50/day per ad ($150/day total)
- Let Facebook algorithm optimize
- Goal: Identify winning creative

**Phase 2: Optimization (Days 8-14)**

- Scale winner by 50% ($75-100/day)
- Create 2 new variations of winner (different images/videos)
- Total budget: $150-200/day

**Phase 3: Scaling (Days 15+)**
- Allocate 80% budget to top performer
- Allocate 20% budget to testing new creatives
- Scale budget by 25% every 3 days (if CPA remains stable)
- Target: $300-500/day within 30 days

---

## AD COPY BEST PRACTICES

### What Works:
✅ Direct, no-nonsense language (Toby Potter voice)
✅ Specific numbers ("28 days," "4,500 people," "$99/month")
✅ Clear benefit statements (not features)
✅ Social proof integration (testimonials, subscriber counts)
✅ Time-bound urgency ("Start today," "Day 1," "28 days")
✅ Single clear CTA (don't confuse with multiple asks)

### What Doesn't Work:
❌ Corporate jargon ("leverage synergies," "optimize outcomes")
❌ Passive voice ("can be transformed by you")
❌ Hedging language ("maybe," "possibly," "might")
❌ Vague promises ("change your life," "find yourself")
❌ Multiple CTAs (confuses action)
❌ Too much text (over 150 words in primary text)

**Segment 3: Email Subscribers (Days 8-14)**
- Message: "You're halfway through. This is where most people transform."
- Urgency: "14 days left. Make them count."

## COMPLIANCE & POLICY CONSIDERATIONS

### Facebook Ad Policies to Avoid:

❌ **Before/After Health Claims:** Don't show physical transformation images

### What's Allowed:

✅ Personal development/transformation (non-health related)
✅ Educational content and courses

✅ Income claims (if realistic and not "guaranteed")
✅ Time-bound challenges and programs

## BUDGET SCALING FRAMEWORK

### Conservative Scaling (Lower Risk):

**Week 1:** $50/day → Test 3 variations
**Week 2:** $75/day → Scale winner by 50%
**Week 3:** $100/day → Add retargeting $25/day
**Week 4:** $150/day → Scale winner, continue testing
**Month 2:** $200-300/day → Predictable CPA
**Month 3+:** $500+/day → Optimize for ROAS

### Aggressive Scaling (Higher Risk, Faster Growth):

**Days 1-3:** $100/day → Test 3 variations
**Days 4-7:** $200/day → Double budget on winner
**Days 8-14:** $400/day → Continue scaling if CPA stable
**Days 15-21:** $600/day → Add retargeting campaigns
**Days 22-30:** $1,000/day → Full funnel optimization
**Month 2+:** $1,500-2,500/day → Scale to list-building goal

**Scaling Rules:**
1. Only scale if CPA remains within target ($5-12)
2. Increase budget by max 25% every 3 days
3. Monitor frequency (keep below 2.5)
4. Refresh creatives every 2 weeks
5. Pause if CPA increases 50%+ for 3+ consecutive days
