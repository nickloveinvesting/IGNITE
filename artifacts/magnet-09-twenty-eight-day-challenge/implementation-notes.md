## OPTIMIZATION PLAYBOOK

### When Landing Page CVR is Low (<18%)

**Diagnose:**
- Check mobile experience (54% of traffic)
- Review headline clarity
- Analyze heat maps (if available)
- Survey visitors who didn't convert

**Test:**
1. Shorter form (remove first name field?)
2. Stronger headline
3. Video above fold (if not already)
4. Reduce text, increase white space
5. Emphasize "free" and "no credit card"

---

### When Email Open Rates Drop

**Diagnose:**
- Check send time (10 AM local optimal?)
- Review subject lines (compelling?)
- Monitor spam complaints
- Check deliverability score

**Test:**
1. Different send times
2. More curiosity-driven subject lines
3. Shorter preview text
4. Re-engagement campaign for non-openers
5. Clean inactive subscribers

---

### When Ad CPA is Too High (>$15)

**Diagnose:**
- Check ad frequency (>3 = fatigue)
- Review CTR (low CTR = creative issue)
- Analyze landing page CVR (ad → page disconnect?)
- Check targeting (too narrow or too broad?)

**Test:**
1. New ad creative (refresh every 2 weeks)
2. Different ad angles (problem-focused vs. solution-focused)
3. Video ads vs. static images
4. Broader or narrower targeting
5. Landing page headline/offer match

---

### When Enrollment Rate is Low (<4%)

**Diagnose:**
- Check challenge completion rate (<65%?)
- Review Day 28 CTA clarity
- Survey completers who didn't enroll
- Analyze "reason for not buying"

**Test:**
1. Stronger CTAs in Days 21-28
2. Add bonus for early enrollment
3. Limited-time discount (e.g., $79 first month)
4. Add testimonials in Days 14-28
5. Implement sales call for high-engagers

---

## RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Email Deliverability Issues

**Mitigation:**
- Proper domain warm-up (2-4 weeks)
- Authenticate sending domain (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Monitor spam complaint rates (<0.1%)
- Remove hard bounces immediately
- Maintain engagement focus (remove non-openers after 90 days)

**Backup Plan:**
- Use established sending domain (not brand new)
- Consider transactional email service (higher deliverability)
- Monitor with tools (GlockApps, Mail Tester)

---

### Risk 2: Facebook Ad Rejection

**Mitigation:**
- Follow ad policies strictly (no personal attributes, health claims)
- Land page matches ad claims exactly
- Avoid sensational language
- Use clear, non-misleading copy

**Backup Plan:**
- Prepare 2-3 ad copy variations (approved alternates)
- Appeal rejections immediately
- Have Google Ads campaign ready as backup

---

### Risk 3: Low Challenge Completion Rate (<50%)

**Mitigation:**
- Front-load value (Day 1 must deliver)
- Keep emails short and actionable (50-75 words Days 2-28)
- Gamify progress ("You're 50% through!")
- Add community element (Facebook group?)

**Backup Plan:**
- Send re-engagement at Day 7 for non-openers
- Survey drop-offs to understand why
- Consider reducing to 14-day or 21-day challenge

---

### Risk 4: Budget Overrun Without ROI

**Mitigation:**
- Set hard CPA limit ($15 max)
- Pause underperforming ads daily
- Only scale ads with CPA <$10
- Track LTV:CAC ratio (target 3:1 minimum)

**Backup Plan:**
- Reduce ad spend to $25-50/day (test mode)
- Focus on organic traffic (free)
- Drive existing email list to challenge

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q: Why 28 days instead of 7 or 14?

**A:** 28 days allows complete methodology preview. Shorter challenges don't provide enough value to justify $99/month enrollment. Research shows 21-28 days is optimal for transformation challenges.

---

### Q: Should I send daily or every other day?

**A:** Daily. The challenge is about consistency and building anticipation. Research shows daily emails work for challenge format (not regular marketing).

---

### Q: What if my email open rates drop below 25%?

**A:** Normal. Days 1-7 have highest engagement (40-60%). Days 22-28 naturally decline (25-35%). If below 20%, send re-engagement email or survey non-openers.

---

### Q: Can I skip the video?

**A:** Yes, initially. Launch with landing page + emails first. Add video in Month 2 after validating email performance. Video increases conversion 10-20% but isn't required.

---

### Q: What's the fastest path to first enrollment?

**A:** Drive existing audience to challenge (if you have one). Otherwise, Facebook ads to cold traffic takes 30-45 days for first enrollments (28-day challenge + decision time).

---

### Q: Should I charge for the challenge ($47)?

**A:** Not initially. Free challenge builds large list. After validating free model, test paid version ($47-97) for higher-intent buyers. Paid challenges have 60-80% completion vs. 65-75% free.

---

### Q: How many leads do I need to hit $10K MRR?

**A:**
- Goal: $10K MRR = 101 members at $99/mo
- Conversion: 5-8% of opt-ins enroll
- Math: 1,300-2,000 challenge opt-ins needed
- Timeline: 2-3 months to generate + convert

---

### Q: Can I use this for a different program/price?

**A:** Yes. Adapt for any $47-297/month program. For higher ticket ($997+), add sales call requirement. For lower ticket ($27-47), consider paid challenge model.

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: LAUNCH FAST
Don't wait for perfection. Get to market in 10-14 days. Iterate based on real data, not assumptions.

### Priority 2: FOCUS ON DAY 1
If Day 1 email doesn't deliver massive value, completion rate suffers. Make Day 1 undeniably valuable.

### Priority 3: MONITOR DAILY (First Month)
Check metrics every morning for first 30 days. Small issues become big problems if ignored.

### Priority 4: REFRESH CREATIVES CONSTANTLY
Ad fatigue is real. Create 2 new ads every 2 weeks or performance will decline.

### Priority 5: SCALE WINNERS AGGRESSIVELY
When you find an ad with CPA <$8, don't be timid. Scale budget 50% immediately.

---

## CONCLUSION

The 28-Day Challenge is **IGNITE's most powerful lead magnet** because it previews the complete methodology.

**This isn't a teaser. It's the real deal.**

When people complete 28 days, they don't wonder "What's IGNITE like?" They already know.

Enrollment becomes obvious, not a hard sell.

**Expected Outcome:**
- **Month 1:** Validate concept, generate first enrollments
- **Month 2-3:** Optimize funnel, scale budget
- **Month 4+:** Predictable $6K-10K/month revenue engine

**The Challenge works. Follow the implementation plan. Launch in 10 days. Scale aggressively.**

---

**This is your highest-converting lead magnet. Treat it accordingly.**
