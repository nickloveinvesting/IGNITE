## FULL SCRIPT

### [00:00-00:30] HOOK

**[OPEN: Direct to camera, intense eye contact]**

**TOBY:**

28 days.

That's how long it takes to see what you're actually capable of.

Not "think about it." Not "get ready." Not "plan to start."

Actually transform.

I'm Toby Potter, founder of IGNITE. And over the next 5 minutes, I'm going to show you exactly what happens when you commit to 28 days of real work.

**[Cut to B-roll: Calendar flipping through 28 days, email notifications appearing on phone, person writing in journal]**

### [00:30-01:30] PROBLEM

**[Back to Toby, direct to camera]**

**TOBY:**

Here's the truth most people won't tell you:

You're stuck.

Maybe it's your job. Maybe it's your income. Maybe it's the gap between where you are and where you know you should be.

And you've tried to fix it.

You've read the books. You've listened to the podcasts. You've told yourself "this year is different."

But nothing actually changed.

**Why?**

Because information without implementation is just entertainment.

You don't need more content. You need a system. A framework. A daily practice that compounds over time.

That's what this 28-day challenge is.

**[B-roll: Person frustrated at desk, scrolling through self-help books, looking defeated]**

**TOBY (V.O.):**

It's not another motivational email series. It's the complete IGNITE transformation methodology—delivered to your inbox daily for 28 days.

**[Cut back to Toby]**

### [01:30-03:30] SOLUTION - EXPLAIN CHALLENGE

**[Toby to camera, with on-screen graphics appearing as he speaks]**

**TOBY:**

Here's how it works.

**Day 1:** You get a full deep-dive on the Pain & Vision Ledger.

This is the tool that changes everything. Because you can't transform what you won't confront.

It forces you to get brutally honest about where you are and where you want to be.

**[Graphic on screen: "DAY 1: PAIN & VISION LEDGER"]**

**TOBY:**

Most people lie to themselves. They minimize the pain. They lower the vision.

Day 1 stops that. You write it all down. The real cost of staying where you are. The real vision of where you're going.

**[Graphic fades, back to Toby]**

**TOBY:**

**Days 2 through 7:** You build the foundation.

You identify your archetype—how you're stuck. Are you an Unmapped Executor? An Analysis-Locked Strategist? A Permission-Seeker?

Once you name your pattern, you can break it.

You write your No-Excuses Mandate. You design your Commitment Protocol. You map your identity.

**[On-screen graphic: "WEEK 1: FOUNDATION" with bullet points appearing]**
- Archetype Quiz
- No-Excuses Mandate
- Commitment Protocol
- Pattern Recognition
- Identity Mapping

**TOBY:**

**Days 8 through 14:** You go deep.

This is where most people discover why they're actually stuck.

You go seven levels deep into your "why." You audit your belief system. You inventory your fears.

You examine your money mindset, your time usage, your energy management.

**[On-screen graphic: "WEEK 2: DEEP WORK" with bullet points]**
- 7 Levels of Why
- Belief System Audit
- Fear Inventory
- Money Mindset
- Time & Energy Audit

**TOBY:**

By Day 14, you're not the same person who started.

**[Back to Toby, leaning in slightly]**

**TOBY:**

**Days 15 through 21:** You build your daily practice.

You write your Identity Statement: "I am becoming someone who..."

You reframe your past. You design your discipline blueprint. You create your morning ritual.

You set up accountability systems. You start tracking progress.

**[On-screen graphic: "WEEK 3: IMPLEMENTATION"]**
- Identity Statement
- Redemptive Reframe
- Daily Discipline Blueprint
- Morning Ritual
- Accountability Systems

**TOBY:**

This is where transformation becomes inevitable.

**[Pause for emphasis]**

**TOBY:**

**Days 22 through 28:** You tie it all together.

You create your 90-day action plan. You build your decision matrix. You design your support system.

You plan for obstacles. You define success metrics. You map your next level.

**[On-screen graphic: "WEEK 4: INTEGRATION"]**
- 90-Day Action Plan
- Decision Matrix
- Support System
- Success Metrics
- Next Level Vision

**TOBY:**

And on Day 28, you decide:

Keep going alone—or join IGNITE for daily coaching, accountability, and community.

### [03:30-04:30] PROOF - SOCIAL PROOF & RESULTS

**[Toby to camera]**

**TOBY:**

Now, you might be thinking: "Does this actually work?"

Let me show you.

**[Cut to testimonial #1: Text on screen + voiceover OR quick video clip]**

**TESTIMONIAL 1:**

"I've been stuck in corporate for 12 years. After the 28-day challenge, I finally saw my pattern: I'm an Inherited-Identity Prisoner. Day 16, I submitted my resignation."

— Marcus T., Former VP of Sales

**[Cut to testimonial #2]**

**TESTIMONIAL 2:**

"Day 1 destroyed me—in the best way. I'd never written down my pain points so honestly. By Day 28, I had a complete roadmap. Three weeks later, I enrolled in IGNITE."

— Jennifer K., Entrepreneur

**[Cut to testimonial #3]**

**TESTIMONIAL 3:**

"Every email hit hard. The 7 Levels of Why on Day 8 made me cry. By the end, I knew exactly what I needed to do—and I did it."

— David R., 1099 Contractor

**[Cut back to Toby]**

**TOBY:**

4,500 people have gone through this challenge.

And the ones who do the work—they transform.

Not because of magic. Not because of motivation.

Because they follow a system. Daily. For 28 days.

**[B-roll: Graph showing "Challenge Completion Rate: 70%" and "Enrollment Rate: 8%"]**

### [04:30-05:15] CTA - CALL TO ACTION

**[Back to Toby, leaning in, intense but supportive]**

**TOBY:**

So here's what happens next.

You go to the link below this video. You enter your name and email. That's it.

Immediately—within 2 minutes—you get Day 1.

The full Pain & Vision Ledger lesson. 1,400 words. Complete teaching, not teaser content.

Then, every day for the next 27 days, you get one lesson.

Short. Actionable. Direct.

**No cost. No catch. No credit card.**

Just 28 days of the complete IGNITE framework.

**[On-screen text appears: "START YOUR 28-DAY CHALLENGE" with URL]**

**TOBY:**

And yes—you'll get offered the full IGNITE program.

But not on Day 1. We're not going to sell you before we deliver value.

You'll experience the methodology first. You'll see what's possible.

And then you'll decide if you want daily coaching, accountability, and community for $99 a month.

If yes, great. If no, that's fine too.

Either way, you'll have 28 days of transformation.

**[Pause]**

**TOBY:**

But here's the thing:

Most people won't do this.

Most people will watch this video, think "that sounds good," and then go back to scrolling.

**Don't be most people.**

- "No cost. No catch." (remove friction)
- "Don't be most people" (final push)

For social media ads and shorter attention spans, create a condensed 2:00 version:

**[00:00-00:20]** Hook + Problem (condensed)
**[00:20-01:10]** Solution (high-level overview)
**[01:10-01:40]** One testimonial + quick proof

---

### Thumbnail Options:

**Option 1:** Toby direct to camera, intense expression
- Text overlay: "28 DAYS TO TRANSFORM YOUR DECISIONS"
- Fire orange text on dark background

**Option 2:** Split screen: "Day 1" vs "Day 28"
- Visual contrast showing transformation
- Text: "What Changes in 28 Days?"

**Option 3:** Simple graphic
- "28 DAYS | 28 LESSONS | COMPLETE TRANSFORMATION"
- Minimal design, high contrast
- IGNITE logo

---

### Distribution Strategy:

**Primary Placements:**
1. Landing page hero section (auto-play muted or click-to-play)
2. YouTube (full 5:30 version)
3. Facebook/Instagram (2:00 condensed version)
4. Email signature (link to YouTube)
5. Retargeting ads (2:00 version)

**YouTube Optimization:**
- Title: "28 Days To Transform Your Decisions (Free Email Challenge)"
- Description: First 2 lines = CTA with link
- Tags: personal development, transformation challenge, IGNITE, Toby Potter
- End screen: Link to landing page + subscribe button
- Cards: Midpoint CTA card linking to landing page

**Facebook/Instagram Optimization:**
