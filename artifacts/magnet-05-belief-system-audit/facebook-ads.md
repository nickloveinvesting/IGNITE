## AD VARIATION #1: THE CONFRONTATION

### Headline
**Your Beliefs Don't Match Your Behavior**

### Primary Text

You know what to do.

You've read the books. Attended the seminars. Set the goals.

But you're not doing it.

The problem isn't discipline. It's not motivation. It's not even time.

It's your belief system.

Your unconscious beliefs are driving decisions you're not even aware of. And those beliefs are keeping you stuck.

Take the free Belief System Audit.

8 questions. 8 minutes. Discover which of 6 belief patterns is running your life—and what it's costing you.

Get your personalized report + 30/60/90-day transformation roadmap.

No cost. No catch. Just truth.

### CTA Button
**Take Free Audit**

### Image/Video Specifications
**Option 1 (Image):** Split image - left side shows person at desk looking frustrated (stuck), right side shows same person confident and focused (unstuck). High contrast. Minimal text overlay: "What's Really Holding You Back?"

**Option 2 (Video):** 15-second video of Toby direct to camera:
```
"You're not lazy. You're not unmotivated. You're operating with a broken belief system. Take my free 8-question audit and discover what's really holding you back."
[CTA graphic appears]
```

### Targeting
- **Interests:** Tony Robbins, Brendon Burchard, personal development, business coaching, mindset
- **Behaviors:** Engaged shoppers (purchased coaching/courses in last 90 days)
- **Job Titles:** Entrepreneur, Coach, Consultant, Manager, Director
- **Exclusions:** IGNITE members, recent purchasers

### Why This Works
- Direct confrontation creates pattern interrupt
- "You know what to do but aren't doing it" speaks to self-aware professionals
- Specific outcome (which of 6 patterns) creates curiosity
- No-cost/no-catch reduces friction
- 8 minutes is low commitment

## AD VARIATION #2: THE PATTERN RECOGNITION

### Headline
**Why You Keep Starting Strong and Quitting When It Gets Hard**

### Primary Text

Same pattern. Different goal.

You start strong. You're motivated. You're committed.

Then it gets difficult.

And you quit.

New business idea? Started, quit.
Fitness goal? Started, quit.
Morning routine? Started, quit.

You think you lack discipline. You're wrong.

You have a belief pattern called "Evidence Collector."

You failed before, so you expect to fail again. And that expectation guarantees it.

It's not your fault. But it is your responsibility.

Take the free Belief System Audit and discover which belief pattern keeps you stuck in this cycle.

8 questions reveal your pattern.
Your personalized report shows you how to break it.

Free. 8 minutes. No sales pitch.

### CTA Button
**Discover My Pattern**

### Image/Video Specifications
**Option 1 (Image):** Circular diagram showing repeated cycle: START → OBSTACLE → QUIT → START → OBSTACLE → QUIT. Center text: "Break The Pattern." Fire orange accent on "Break."

**Option 2 (Carousel):** 3 cards showing:
- Card 1: "You start strong" (image: enthusiastic person)
- Card 2: "It gets hard" (image: frustrated person)
- Card 3: "You quit" (image: defeated person)
- Card 4: "This is a belief problem" (CTA)

### Targeting
- **Interests:** Self-improvement, goal setting, habit formation, productivity
- **Behaviors:** Purchased fitness programs, online courses, coaching services
- **Age:** 30-50 (peak "stuck despite trying" demographic)
- **Exclusions:** Completed quiz in last 90 days

### Why This Works
- Identifies with specific recurring pattern
- Names the pattern (Evidence Collector) - creates curiosity about other patterns
- Absolves fault but assigns responsibility
- Speaks to people tired of starting over
- Pattern recognition is high-value insight

## AD VARIATION #3: THE COST CALCULATOR

### Headline
**The Hidden Cost of Belief-Behavior Misalignment**

### Primary Text

What's it costing you?

Not the beliefs you claim to have.

The beliefs your behavior proves you actually have.

You say you value health. But you cancel the gym when work gets busy.

You say you value financial freedom. But you won't take the risk.

You say you value authenticity. But you change based on who you're with.

This gap—between stated values and actual beliefs—is costing you:

→ Opportunities you're too scared to take
→ Relationships you're sacrificing for approval
→ Income you're leaving on the table
→ Years stuck in the same pattern

And you're rationalizing it as "being realistic."

Take the Belief System Audit.

See your exact Belief Alignment Score (0-100).
Discover which belief pattern is sabotaging your goals.
Get your personalized roadmap to close the gap.

8 minutes. Free. No upsell.

### CTA Button
**Calculate My Alignment Score**

### Image/Video Specifications
**Option 1 (Image):** Split screen comparison:
- Left: "What You Say You Value" (list: Health, Freedom, Growth)
- Right: "What Your Behavior Proves" (list: Work, Security, Comfort)
- Center: Large gap with text "This Gap is Costing You"

**Option 2 (Video):** 20-second explainer video:
```

"You say you value health" [person at gym]
"But you sacrifice it for work" [person at desk, late night]
"This is the belief-behavior gap" [gap visualization]
"And it's costing you more than you realize" [counter showing years/opportunities/income]
"Take the free Belief System Audit" [CTA]
"Know your gap. Close your gap." [end screen]

## COPY PRINCIPLES FOR SELF-AWARE PROFESSIONALS

### What Works
1. **Acknowledge their awareness:** "You already know you're stuck"
2. **Challenge their excuses:** "It's not time. It's beliefs."
3. **Be direct:** No fluff, get to the point
4. **Use specific examples:** Not "improve your life" but "stop quitting when it gets hard"
5. **Quantify outcomes:** "8 questions," "6 patterns," "Alignment Score 0-100"
6. **Remove risk:** "Free," "8 minutes," "No upsell"

### What Doesn't Work
1. Generic motivation ("You can do it!")
2. Vague benefits ("Transform your life")
3. Hype language ("SHOCKING discovery")
4. Long-winded explanations
5. Testimonials in ad copy (save for landing page)
6. Multiple CTAs (confuses the action)
