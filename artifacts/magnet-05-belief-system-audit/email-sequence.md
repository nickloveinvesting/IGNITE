### EMAIL BODY

```
Subject: Your Belief System Audit Results: [PATTERN TYPE]

[FIRST_NAME],

Your Belief System Audit is complete.

Your Primary Pattern: [PATTERN TYPE]
Your Belief Alignment Score: [SCORE]/100

[DOWNLOAD YOUR COMPLETE REPORT]

Here's what this means:

Your [PATTERN TYPE] belief system is driving decisions you're not even aware of. It shows up when you [SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR FROM THEIR ANSWERS]. It's why you [SPECIFIC PATTERN THEY IDENTIFIED]. And it's costing you [SPECIFIC COST].

The good news? Once you see it, you can change it.

Your complete report (attached) breaks down:
→ How this pattern formed
→ Where it shows up in your life right now
→ What it's costing you
→ Your 30/60/90-day roadmap to rewire it

Over the next 12 days, I'm sending you 6 more emails specifically for [PATTERN TYPE] operators.

No fluff. No generic advice. Just what you need to shift this pattern.

If you don't want these emails, unsubscribe. I won't be offended.

But if you're serious about closing the gap between who you are and who you're capable of becoming, stick around.

- Toby

P.S. Read the report today. Don't let this become another PDF you download and never open. You took the assessment for a reason. Follow through.

## EMAIL 2: PATTERN-SPECIFIC QUICK WIN

**Send:** Day 2

**Subject Line:** "The one thing [PATTERN TYPE] operators get wrong"

---

### FOR SCARCITY OPERATORS

```
Subject: The one thing Scarcity Operators get wrong

[FIRST_NAME],

Quick question: What financial opportunity did you say no to in the last 90 days because it "felt risky"?

Here's what actually happened.

You didn't assess risk. You felt fear and called it wisdom.

Scarcity Operators mistake loss-aversion for intelligence. You think you're being smart. You're actually being scared.

Here's the pattern:

→ Opportunity appears
→ You immediately calculate what you could lose
→ Fear spikes
→ You rationalize the "no" as prudence
→ Opportunity passes
→ You feel relief (short-term) and regret (long-term)

And you wonder why you're still stuck.

Try this instead:

Next time you feel that fear spike, ask these three questions:

1. "What's the actual worst-case scenario?" (Be specific, not catastrophic)
2. "Could I recover from that scenario within 12 months?"
3. "What's the cost of staying exactly where I am?"

Most Scarcity Operators dramatically overestimate downside risk and completely ignore the cost of inaction.

That's the belief. Now you can challenge it.

Reply and tell me: What opportunity are you currently avoiding because of fear disguised as wisdom?

- Toby

### FOR APPROVAL SEEKERS

```
Subject: The one thing Approval Seekers get wrong

[FIRST_NAME],

Quick question: Whose life are you living?

Here's what I mean.

You said someone's disappointment made you question your decision. That's the tell.

Approval Seekers don't have opinions—they have sensors. You constantly scan the environment for what others expect, then adjust accordingly.

You think you're being considerate. You're actually disappearing.

Here's the pattern:

→ You make a decision aligned with what you want
→ Someone expresses disappointment
→ You immediately question yourself
→ You adjust to restore approval
→ You lose yourself a little more

And you wonder why you feel like a stranger in your own life.

Try this instead:

For the next 7 days, when someone expresses disappointment in your choice, do this:

1. Notice the urge to justify or change your decision
2. Don't act on it
3. Say: "I understand that's disappointing for you. This is still the right choice for me."
4. Sit with the discomfort

Your worth isn't determined by other people's approval. But you'll never believe that until you practice withdrawing from the approval market.

Reply and tell me: What decision are you avoiding because you know someone will disapprove?

- Toby
```

### FOR PERFECTIONIST PROCRASTINATORS

```
Subject: The one thing Perfectionist Procrastinators get wrong

[FIRST_NAME],

Quick question: What are you waiting for?

Here's the truth.

You said you avoided a situation until the last minute. You think you're waiting for clarity. You're actually waiting for certainty that will never come.

Perfectionist Procrastinators mistake preparation for progress. You think you're being thorough. You're actually being afraid.

Here's the pattern:

→ Opportunity or deadline appears
→ You identify everything that could go wrong
→ You tell yourself you need more information/time/resources
→ You research, plan, and prepare
→ Deadline forces action
→ You rush, perform below your capability, confirm your fear

And you wonder why you never perform at your potential.

Try this instead:

Next time you catch yourself "preparing," set a timer for 25 minutes and start the actual work.

Not planning. Not researching. Not optimizing.

The actual thing you're avoiding.

Perfect is the enemy of done. Done is the enemy of stuck. And you've been stuck because you're waiting for perfect.

Your belief: "I can't start until I'm fully prepared."
The truth: "I can't be fully prepared until I start."

Reply and tell me: What project have you been "preparing" for that you could start today?

- Toby
```

### FOR WORTHY-WHEN ACHIEVERS

```
Subject: The one thing Worthy-When Achievers get wrong

[FIRST_NAME],

Quick question: When was the last time you rested without guilt?

Can't remember? That's the pattern.

You said you cancelled personal commitments when work got intense. You think you're being dedicated. You're actually running from worthlessness.

Worthy-When Achievers believe worth is earned, not inherent. Rest feels like laziness. Self-care feels selfish. And burnout feels inevitable.

Here's the pattern:

→ Pressure increases
→ You sacrifice health, relationships, rest
→ You feel virtuous in the sacrifice
→ You burn out
→ Productivity drops
→ You feel worthless
→ You work harder to earn worth back

And the cycle continues until something breaks.

Try this instead:

This week, protect one non-negotiable: gym time, dinner with family, 8 hours of sleep—pick one.

When the urge comes to sacrifice it for work, recognize the belief underneath:

"My worth is determined by my productivity."

That's a lie. Your worth is inherent. Productivity is an output, not a prerequisite.

You don't have to earn the right to rest. You need rest to sustain performance.

Reply and tell me: What non-negotiable are you committing to protect this week?

- Toby
```

---

### FOR FIXED-CAPACITY BELIEVERS

```
Subject: The one thing Fixed-Capacity Believers get wrong

[FIRST_NAME],

Quick question: What would you attempt if you believed you could have it all?

Here's why that question is hard for you.

You operate as if life is zero-sum. Success in one area requires sacrifice in another. You can't imagine being successful AND healthy AND happy simultaneously.

Fixed-Capacity Believers mistake trade-offs for truth. You think balance is impossible. You've just never seen someone model it.

Here's the pattern:

→ Opportunity appears in one domain (career, health, relationships)
→ You immediately identify what you'll have to sacrifice
→ You choose based on current priority
→ The neglected area deteriorates
→ You tell yourself "you can't have everything"
→ You collect evidence supporting that belief

And you stay stuck in artificial either/or choices.

Try this instead:

List three goals: one career, one health, one personal.

Now ask: "How could I design my life to achieve all three simultaneously?"

Not "which should I prioritize?" That's the old belief talking.

Force yourself to solve for integration, not elimination.

Most successful people aren't better at sacrifice. They're better at design.

Reply and tell me: What three goals would you pursue if you believed integration was possible?

- Toby
```

---

### FOR EVIDENCE COLLECTORS

```
Subject: The one thing Evidence Collectors get wrong

[FIRST_NAME],

Quick question: How many times do you need to fail before you succeed?

Trick question. There's no limit.

You said you've tried and quit when it got hard. You think past failure predicts future results. You're actually creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Evidence Collectors mistake pattern for destiny. You failed before, so you expect to fail again. And that expectation guarantees it.

Here's the pattern:

→ You attempt something difficult
→ You encounter obstacles
→ Your brain serves up memories of past failures
→ You interpret obstacles as confirmation you'll fail
→ You quit
→ You collect more evidence supporting "I can't do this"

And the library of limiting beliefs grows.

Try this instead:

When you catch yourself thinking "I've tried this before and it didn't work," add one word:

"I've tried this before and it didn't work *then*."

Then isn't now. Past you had different knowledge, different resources, different support.

Every failure is data, not destiny. The only way to guarantee future failure is to stop trying.

Reply and tell me: What have you written off as "impossible for you" based on past evidence?

- Toby
```

## EMAIL 3: STORY + DEPTH

**Send:** Day 4

**Subject:** "How I discovered my own belief system was broken"

```
[FIRST_NAME],

I spent three years knowing exactly what I needed to do and not doing it.

I'd read the books. Attended the seminars. Set the goals. Written the plans.

And every Monday, I'd start strong. By Wednesday, I'd be making excuses. By Friday, I'd be beating myself up. By Sunday, I'd be planning to start again Monday.

I thought I lacked discipline. Turns out, I had a belief problem.

Here's what I discovered:

I believed success required sacrifice. Not just hard work—actual sacrifice. Health for wealth. Relationships for results. Joy for achievement.

So every time I started making progress, my subconscious would sabotage it.

Because if I succeeded WITHOUT sacrifice, that belief would be proven wrong. And our brains will do anything to keep our beliefs intact—even if those beliefs are destroying us.

I had to get honest about the gap between what I claimed to believe and what my behavior proved I actually believed.

That's what your Belief System Audit revealed about you.

Now the question is: what are you going to do about it?

Where are you right now? Still making excuses for the gap? Or ready to close it?

Reply and tell me.

- Toby

P.S. The gap doesn't close by accident. It closes through deliberate, uncomfortable, repeated action. If you're waiting to "feel ready," you're not.
```

## EMAIL 4: ADDRESS OBJECTION

**Send:** Day 6

**Subject:** "I don't have time to work on my beliefs" (and other lies)

```
[FIRST_NAME],

Let me guess what you're thinking:

"This Belief System Audit was interesting. The insights were valuable. But I don't have time to actually work on this right now. Maybe when things calm down."

Here's the problem.

Things don't calm down. You're not too busy to work on your beliefs. Your beliefs are WHY you're too busy.

Let me say that again:

Your limiting beliefs are creating the exact circumstances you're using as an excuse not to address them.

If you're a Worthy-When Achiever, your belief that worth comes from productivity is why you're drowning in tasks.

If you're a Perfectionist Procrastinator, your belief that you need perfect conditions is why you're always behind.

If you're a Scarcity Operator, your belief that opportunities are rare is why you can't afford the time.

The belief creates the pattern. The pattern creates the excuse. The excuse protects the belief.

It's a closed loop. And you're stuck inside it.

Here's the truth:

You don't need more time. You need different beliefs.

And changing beliefs doesn't require hours of therapy or meditation retreats.

It requires:
→ 10 minutes a day of awareness
→ One conscious choice that contradicts the old belief
→ Repetition until the new belief becomes automatic

That's it.

You have 10 minutes. You're just scared that if you actually do the work, you'll run out of excuses.

Reply and tell me the real reason you're not acting on your audit results.

- Toby

## EMAIL 5: INTRODUCE IGNITE

**Send:** Day 8

**Subject:** "What is IGNITE? (and who it's for)"

```
[FIRST_NAME],

You've been reading my emails for over a week now. You took the Belief System Audit. You know your pattern.

So let me tell you about IGNITE.

IGNITE is a $99/month program for high-performers who are stuck despite doing everything "right."

It's not for beginners. It's not for people looking for motivation.

It's for people who:
→ Know what to do but aren't doing it
→ See the pattern but can't break it
→ Have the knowledge but lack the transformation
→ Are tired of consuming content and ready to change behavior

Inside IGNITE:

**Weekly Deep Dives:** Live coaching on the exact belief systems holding you back (Belief audits, identity work, pattern interruption)

**Accountability Framework:** Weekly check-ins, progress tracking, and public commitment to ensure you actually do the work

**Private Community:** Other high-performers working on the same patterns (Approval Seekers supporting Approval Seekers, Scarcity Operators challenging Scarcity Operators)

**30/60/90-Day Roadmaps:** Customized transformation plans based on your specific belief pattern (Not generic—precise)

**Access to Me:** Direct messaging for when you're stuck, spiraling, or need a perspective shift

It's not therapy. It's not coaching in the traditional sense.

It's a system for rewiring belief patterns that have been running your life unconsciously.

Sound like you? Learn more: [LINK TO IGNITE SALES PAGE]

Not for you? Keep reading these emails. I'll keep delivering value regardless.

But if you're [PATTERN TYPE] and you're ready to stop analyzing and start transforming, this is how.

## EMAIL 6: SOCIAL PROOF

**Send:** Day 10

**Subject:** "How [Name] went from [Pattern Type] to aligned in 90 days"

```
[FIRST_NAME],

Don't take my word for it.

Sarah was a textbook Worthy-When Achiever.

Six-figure income. Successful business. Burning out every 6 months like clockwork.

She knew the pattern. She could articulate it perfectly. She just couldn't stop it.

Here's what changed when she joined IGNITE:

Week 1: Identified the origin of "worth through productivity" (father's approval tied to grades, carried into adulthood)

Week 4: Protected her first non-negotiable boundary (gym 4x/week) despite client pressure

Week 8: Revenue increased 30% while working 10 fewer hours (because energy and focus improved)

Week 12: Reported feeling "calm for the first time in a decade"

Her words: "I thought I needed more discipline. I needed different beliefs. IGNITE showed me how to rewire them."

---

Marcus was a Scarcity Operator.

Every business decision driven by fear of loss. Turned down partnerships. Undercharged clients. Hoarded cash while the business suffered.

He took the Belief System Audit. Score: 31/100 alignment.

Here's his IGNITE journey:

Week 2: Made first abundance-based decision (hired support before he felt "ready")

Week 6: Raised prices 40% (lost 2 clients, signed 5 new ones at higher rates)

Week 10: Invested in marketing he'd been avoiding for 2 years

Week 12: Revenue up 60%, profit up 80%, anxiety down significantly

His words: "I was making poverty decisions with a prosperity mindset. IGNITE helped me align them."

---

These are real people. Real results.

Not typical. Not guaranteed. But possible.

The difference wasn't motivation. It was a systematic approach to belief change with accountability.

If you're ready to do the work, IGNITE shows you how: [LINK]

- Toby

P.S. The program is $99/month. Cancel anytime. No contracts. No BS. Just transformation or you leave.

## EMAIL 7: DECISION POINT

**Send:** Day 12

**Subject:** "You're in or you're out"

```
[FIRST_NAME],

You've been reading my emails for 12 days.

You know what your Belief System Audit revealed. You know your pattern. You know what it's costing you.

You know what IGNITE is. You know what it offers. You've seen the results.

So here's where I draw the line:

You're either serious about closing the gap between who you are and who you're capable of becoming, or you're not.

If you are: Join IGNITE: [LINK]

If you're not: Unsubscribe. Stop consuming content. Stop taking assessments. Stop lying to yourself that awareness equals change.

I respect either decision.

What I don't respect is staying comfortable while complaining. Collecting insights while avoiding action. Knowing better while doing worse.

You downloaded the audit because something isn't working. The audit showed you what.

Now you have a choice:

Change the belief system creating the pattern, or keep the pattern and stop complaining about the results.

Choose.

- Toby

P.S. IGNITE is $99/month. Cancel anytime. First 30 days, if you do the work and see no shift, I'll refund you personally. No questions. But you have to actually do the work.
