## SCRIPT

### [0:00-0:15] HOOK (Pattern Interrupt)

**[VISUAL: Close-up, direct to camera, intense eye contact]**

**TOBY:**
You're not lazy.

You're not unmotivated.

You're not lacking discipline.

You're operating with a broken belief system.

And that's why you're stuck.

**[VISUAL: Text overlay appears: "Broken Belief System"]**

---

### [0:16-0:45] PROBLEM AGITATION (Name The Pain)

**[VISUAL: Continue direct to camera]**

**TOBY:**
You know exactly what you need to do.

You've read the books. You've attended the seminars. You've set the goals. You've written the plans.

But you're not doing it.

**[VISUAL: B-roll montage - books on shelf, notebook with goals, laptop with courses]**

And every Monday, you start strong.

By Wednesday, you're making excuses.

By Friday, you're beating yourself up.

By Sunday, you're planning to start again Monday.

**[VISUAL: Back to camera]**

Same cycle. Different week.

You think it's a discipline problem.

It's not.

**[VISUAL: Text overlay: "It's Not Discipline"]**

---

### [0:46-1:30] ROOT CAUSE REVELATION (The Real Problem)

**[VISUAL: Direct to camera, lean forward slightly]**

**TOBY:**
Here's what's actually happening.

Your conscious mind sets goals.

Your belief system determines if you achieve them.

**[VISUAL: Split screen graphic - left side "Conscious Goals," right side "Unconscious Beliefs"]**

Most of your decisions—about 70% of them—are driven by unconscious beliefs you're not even aware of.

Beliefs you formed by age six. Beliefs you've been operating on for decades.

**[VISUAL: Back to camera]**

And here's the kicker:

Your stated beliefs—what you THINK you believe—don't match your operating beliefs—what your BEHAVIOR proves you actually believe.

**[VISUAL: B-roll - person saying one thing, doing another]**

You say you value health. But you cancel the gym when work gets busy.

You say you value financial freedom. But you won't take the risk.

You say you value authenticity. But you change based on who you're with.

**[VISUAL: Back to camera, direct]**

This gap—between what you claim to believe and what you actually believe—is why you're stuck.

---

### [1:31-2:15] THE RESEARCH (Build Credibility)

**[VISUAL: Continue direct to camera, more conversational tone]**

**TOBY:**
Research from the last 40 years confirms this.

**[VISUAL: Research graphics appear as cited]**

Half of people—50%—fail to act on their stated intentions.

Not because they're weak. Because their beliefs contradict their goals.

**[Text overlay: "50% Intention-Behavior Gap"]**

By age six, your core belief system is formed. You've been running on that operating system ever since.

**[Text overlay: "Age 6: Belief System Locked"]**

And here's the problem: beliefs create self-fulfilling prophecies.

**[VISUAL: Circular diagram animation]**

If you believe "I'm not good with money," you avoid financial education, make poor decisions, lose money, and confirm the belief.

The belief creates the behavior. The behavior creates the result. The result confirms the belief.

**[VISUAL: Back to camera]**

You're stuck in a loop. And awareness alone won't break it.

---

### [2:16-3:00] THE SOLUTION (Introduce The Audit)

**[VISUAL: Direct to camera, energy shift to solution mode]**

**TOBY:**
That's why I created the Belief System Audit.

**[VISUAL: Show quiz interface or landing page]**

It's an 8-question assessment that reveals which belief pattern is running your life.

Not theory. Not hypotheticals.

Real questions about your actual behaviors in the last 30 days.

**[VISUAL: Screenshots of sample questions]**

Because what you've DONE reveals what you actually believe.

Not what you think you believe. What you actually believe.

**[VISUAL: Back to camera]**

The assessment takes 8 minutes.

You'll discover which of 6 belief patterns is driving your decisions:

**[VISUAL: Graphic showing 6 patterns as list]**

**VOICEOVER while graphic displays:**

The Scarcity Operator - making every decision from fear of loss

The Approval Seeker - optimizing for external validation

The Perfectionist Procrastinator - delaying execution while waiting for perfect conditions

The Worthy-When Achiever - believing your worth must be earned through productivity

The Fixed-Capacity Believer - thinking success in one area requires sacrifice in another

The Evidence Collector - expecting future failure based on past results

**[VISUAL: Back to camera]**

---

### [3:01-3:45] THE VALUE DELIVERY (What They Get)

**[VISUAL: Screen recording showing results page/report]**

**TOBY:**
When you complete the audit, you get:

Your Primary Belief Pattern - which pattern is dominant

**[VISUAL: Sample pattern result page]**

Your Belief Alignment Score - a 0 to 100 score showing the gap between your stated values and actual beliefs

**[VISUAL: Sample alignment score graphic]**

A Personalized Report - showing exactly how this pattern shows up in your career, relationships, money, and health

**[VISUAL: Flip through report pages]**

And a 30/60/90-Day Roadmap - specific steps to rewire this pattern

**[VISUAL: Sample roadmap page]**

**[VISUAL: Back to camera]**

Not generic advice.

A precise strategy for YOUR operating system.

---

### [3:46-4:15] OBJECTION HANDLING (Build Trust)

**[VISUAL: Direct to camera, serious tone]**

**TOBY:**
Let me be clear about what this is and what it isn't.

This isn't a sales funnel disguised as value.

It's a diagnostic tool.

**[VISUAL: Text overlay: "No Upsell. No Pitch. Just Truth."]**

You'll get real insights about your belief system whether you ever work with me or not.

There's no cost. No credit card. No bait and switch.

**[VISUAL: Back to camera, lean in]**

I built this because I was stuck for three years knowing exactly what to do and not doing it.

And when I finally discovered my belief system was the problem, everything changed.

I want that for you.

### [4:16-4:50] CALL TO ACTION (Clear Next Step)

**[VISUAL: Direct to camera, confident energy]**

**TOBY:**
So here's what to do next.

Click the link below this video.

**[VISUAL: CTA graphic with URL appears at bottom third]**

You'll land on a page with the assessment.

Take 8 minutes. Answer 8 questions. Be honest.

Get your pattern. Get your score. Get your roadmap.

**[VISUAL: Quick montage - landing page, quiz, results]**

**[VISUAL: Back to camera]**

Then decide what to do with that information.

You can keep operating with the same belief system that's kept you stuck.

Or you can challenge it. Change it. And finally close the gap between who you are and who you're capable of becoming.
