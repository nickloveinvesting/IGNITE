Hey [First Name],

Your Redemptive Story Reframe worksheet is ready.

**[DOWNLOAD BUTTON: Get Your Worksheet]**

Before you dive in, I want to acknowledge something:

**You just took a brave step.**

Most people spend their entire lives hiding from their painful past. Pretending it didn't happen. Hoping no one finds out. Carrying shame in silence.

You chose differently.

You chose to face it. To reframe it. To transform it into something powerful.

That takes courage.

---

**HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO:**

Over the next 60 minutes, you're going to walk through 5 prompts that will help you:

✓ Name the painful experience you've been carrying as shame
✓ Extract the wisdom buried in that pain
✓ Identify the specific strengths you developed because of it
✓ Discover who you're uniquely qualified to serve because of what you went through
✓ Write your complete redemptive story—the foundation of your brand

This isn't therapy (though it might feel therapeutic).
This isn't journaling (though you'll be writing).

**This is strategy.**

Your redemptive story is the most powerful marketing asset you have. By the end of this worksheet, you'll know exactly how to use it.

---

**A FEW TIPS BEFORE YOU START:**

**1. Be honest.** You don't have to share this publicly yet. But you do have to be honest with yourself. The more specific you are, the more powerful your story will be.

**2. Take your time.** Some prompts will be easy. Some will be hard. That's normal. The hard ones are where the breakthrough happens.

**3. Complete it in one sitting if possible.** 60 minutes of focused time is ideal. Momentum matters. Each prompt builds on the last.

**4. Remember: you're not broken.** Your past doesn't disqualify you. It qualifies you. What happened TO you doesn't define you. What you DO with it does.

---

**READY?**

**[CTA BUTTON: Download My Worksheet]**

When you're done, I'd love to hear from you. Hit reply and tell me:
- Which prompt was most powerful for you?
- What did you discover about your story?

Your redemptive story matters. I'm honored to help you uncover it.

Let's do this.

IGNITE

P.S. If you get stuck on any prompt, don't overthink it. Write what comes to mind. You can always refine it later. The important thing is to START. Your story is waiting.

---

- **CTA Buttons:** Fire Orange (#FF4D00), clear and prominent
- **Footer:** Include IGNITE branding, unsubscribe link, privacy assurance

---

## EMAIL 2: YOUR PAIN IS YOUR QUALIFICATION
**Timing:** Day 3 after download
**Purpose:** Share vulnerable story, provide additional value, soft introduction to IGNITE

---

### **Subject Line Options (A/B Test These):**

**Option A (Reframe):** "Your pain is your qualification (not your disqualification)"
**Option B (Confession):** "The story I was afraid to tell"
**Option C (Question):** "What if your biggest failure is your unfair advantage?"

**Recommended:** Option A (directly addresses the core reframe)

---

### **EMAIL 2 BODY:**

**Pre-Header Text:** "The thing you're most ashamed of is probably your superpower."

---

**Subject:** Your pain is your qualification (not your disqualification)

---

Hey [First Name],

I want to tell you a story I was ashamed of for years.

**[Note: This section should include YOUR authentic redemptive story or a powerful client case study. Below is a template—replace with real story.]**

---

In 2015, I lost everything.

My business failed. I had $67,000 in debt. I had to move back in with my parents at 34 years old.

I felt like a complete fraud.

I'd been coaching people on success and freedom, and I couldn't even pay my own rent. The shame was crushing.

I thought: "Who am I to teach anyone anything? Look at my life. I'm a failure."

For two years, I hid that story. I edited my bio to skip over those years. I avoided conversations about my past. I was terrified someone would find out.

Then I had a realization that changed everything:

**My failure wasn't my disqualification. It was my qualification.**

That bankruptcy taught me financial discipline that success never could.
That public humiliation taught me resilience and humility.
That rock-bottom moment taught me what actually matters.

The people I'm best equipped to serve aren't the ones who've had easy lives.

They're the ones who've failed. Who've been knocked down. Who carry shame about their past.

I can help them BECAUSE I've been there. My mess became my message.

---

**HERE'S WHAT I LEARNED:**

**1. Pain points to what you value.**
We hurt where we care. My financial failure taught me I deeply value freedom and security. That pain revealed my purpose.

**2. Your struggle is your credibility.**
You don't build authority by pretending to be perfect. You build it by surviving something real and coming back stronger.

**3. Vulnerability is a competitive advantage.**
Research shows 92% of people trust individuals over companies. And 99 out of 100 entrepreneurs won't show their whole selves. Your willingness to be real is what differentiates you.

**4. Redemptive stories are what people WANT to hear.**
Studies show people reliably prefer redemptive stories and judge the narrators as more likable and trustworthy. Your comeback story isn't a liability—it's what people are drawn to.

---

**NOW, A QUESTION FOR YOU:**

Have you completed the Redemptive Story Reframe worksheet yet?

If yes—**I want to hear your story.** Hit reply and share what you discovered. I read every response.

If not—**what's holding you back?** Is it fear? Shame? Not sure where to start? Reply and tell me. Let me help you through it.

Your story matters more than you think.

The thing you're most ashamed of? That's probably your superpower.

Let's uncover it together.

## EMAIL 3: CASE STUDY + IGNITE OFFER
**Timing:** Day 5 after download
**Purpose:** Provide social proof via case study, make clear IGNITE offer, create decision point

---

### **Subject Line Options (A/B Test These):**

**Option A (Case Study):** "How Sarah turned bankruptcy into a 6-figure coaching business"
**Option B (Direct Value):** "Your redemptive story + what comes next"
**Option C (Question):** "What will your next chapter be?"

**Recommended:** Option A (curiosity-driven, specific social proof)

---

### **EMAIL 3 BODY:**

**Pre-Header Text:** "She rewrote her story. Then she rewrote her life."

---

**Subject:** How Sarah turned bankruptcy into a 6-figure coaching business

---

Hey [First Name],

Let me tell you about Sarah.

She joined IGNITE three months ago carrying a story she thought disqualified her from ever coaching anyone about money:

**She'd declared bankruptcy twice.**

Credit cards. Failed business. Medical debt. Rock bottom at 42 years old.

She thought: "How can I ever help anyone with finances when I destroyed my own?"

But here's what happened when she went through the Redemptive Story Reframe:

**She realized her bankruptcy wasn't her disqualification—it was her QUALIFICATION.**

That experience taught her:
- Financial discipline that people born into wealth never learn
- Empathy for people struggling with debt (she's been there)
- Strategic systems to rebuild from zero (she did it)
- Resilience through shame and public failure (she survived it)

**Today, Sarah runs a 6-figure financial coaching business specifically for people recovering from bankruptcy and debt.**

Her clients don't want a coach who's never struggled. They want someone who's been in the pit and climbed out. Someone who knows the way.

**Her pain became her niche.
Her shame became her credibility.
Her mess became her message.**

And it all started with reframing her story.

---

**HERE'S THE TRUTH:**

Your redemptive story is the foundation. But it's just the beginning.

Sarah's transformation didn't stop with rewriting her past. She had to:
- **Dismantle the limiting beliefs** that kept her playing small
- **Rebuild her identity** from "financial failure" to "financial guide"
- **Create a business** aligned with her redemptive purpose
- **Surround herself with people** writing similar comeback stories

That's why she joined **IGNITE**.

---
