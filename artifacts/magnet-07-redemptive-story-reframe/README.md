## CORE CONCEPT

**Problem:** Entrepreneurs with painful pasts (bankruptcy, addiction, divorce, failure) carry shame and think their history disqualifies them from success.

**Solution:** The Redemptive Story Reframe worksheet guides them through 5 prompts to extract wisdom from pain, identify strengths gained through struggle, and write their complete redemptive narrative—the foundation of their brand.

**Unique Value:** First DIY redemptive story extraction tool that bridges therapeutic depth with tactical marketing application. Backed by 30+ years of narrative psychology research.

## FINAL NOTES

**Differentiation:** This lead magnet fills a critical market gap. While belief worksheets and personality quizzes exist, and story frameworks are taught, no one offers a behavior-based redemptive story extraction tool with therapeutic depth AND marketing application at this level of sophistication.

**Conversion Advantage:** Story-based lead magnets with interactive elements convert significantly higher than static PDFs. The worksheet format creates immediate personal value (your unique story) while demonstrating your coaching methodology.

**Profitability:** With $3-8 CPL and 5-8% email-to-IGNITE conversion, this lead magnet becomes profitable by Month 1-2. At scale, expect 2.5-7X ROI over 90-day customer lifetime (conservative to optimized scenarios).

**Implementation Readiness:** All materials are production-ready. Can launch MVP in 2 weeks with <$1,000 investment. Full optimized version deployable in 8 weeks.
