### **Page 2: Introduction - Your Past Is Your Proof**

**Headline:** Your Past Isn't a Prison. It's Proof.

**Body Copy:**
```
If you're reading this, you've been through something painful.

Maybe it's a failed business. Bankruptcy. Addiction. Divorce. A public failure that you
still carry shame about.

You think your past disqualifies you from success. You see other entrepreneurs with
"perfect" backstories and wonder, "Who am I to teach anyone anything?"

Here's what you need to know:

YOUR PAST DOESN'T DISQUALIFY YOU. IT QUALIFIES YOU.

Every successful person has a redemptive story:
• Steve Jobs was fired from Apple (then came back and created the iPhone)
• Sara Blakely failed the LSAT twice (then created Spanx and became a billionaire)
• Walt Disney was fired for "lack of imagination" (then built the Disney empire)
• Oprah Winfrey survived childhood abuse and was fired from TV (then became a media mogul)

The thing you're most ashamed of? That's your superpower.

This worksheet will help you reframe your painful past into your most powerful marketing
asset in the next 60 minutes.

Not through denial. Not through toxic positivity.

Through honest, authentic reframing that transforms shame into strength,
failure into fuel, and your mess into your message.

Let's begin.
```

### **Page 5: The 5-Prompt Redemptive Story Framework**

**Headline:** The Framework: 5 Questions That Change Everything

**Body Copy:**
```
This framework is based on 30+ years of narrative psychology research showing that people
who tell more redemptive stories—transitions from negative to positive states characterized
by recovery, growth, or learning—have significantly higher psychological well-being, life
satisfaction, and sense of purpose.

The way you tell your story literally changes who you become.

Here's how it works:
```

**The 5 Prompts (Overview):**

**PROMPT 1: What Painful Experience Shaped You?**
Identify the event or season you've been carrying as shame. Name it. Own it.

**PROMPT 2: What Did You Learn?**
Extract the wisdom buried in the pain. What did this teach you that success never could?

**PROMPT 3: How Has It Made You Stronger?**
Identify the specific strengths, skills, and resilience you developed through this experience.

**PROMPT 4: Who Does This Wisdom Help You Serve?**
Discover how your pain points to your purpose. Who needs what you learned?

**PROMPT 5: Your Redemptive Story (The Reframe)**
Write your complete redemptive narrative using the 5-part framework. This becomes your signature story.

---

**Design Note:** Include a visual diagram showing the 5 prompts as steps in a journey from "The Fall" to "The Rise" with fire orange path connecting them.

---

### **Pages 6-7: PROMPT 1 - What Painful Experience Shaped You?**

**Headline:** PROMPT 1: What Painful Experience Shaped You?

**Subheadline:** Identify the event or season you've been carrying as shame. Name it. Own it.

**Guidance Copy:**
```
This is the hardest part: naming the thing you've been avoiding.

You don't have to share this publicly (yet). But you do have to be honest with yourself.

What happened that you're still ashamed of?
What failure do you hide from people?
What part of your past do you wish you could erase?

Write it down. All of it. The specifics matter.

IMPORTANT: This is externalization—separating the problem from you as a person.
Instead of "I am a failure," write "I experienced a business failure."

You are not your past. Your past is something that happened to you. You're about to
transform it.
```

**Prompts:**

1. **Describe the painful experience in detail:**
   - What happened?
   - When did it happen?
   - What were the specific circumstances?

   _[Large writing space]_

2. **How did it make you feel at the time?**
   - Shame? Fear? Humiliation? Worthlessness?
   - Be specific about the emotions.

   _[Writing space]_

3. **What did you lose (or think you lost)?**
   - Money? Status? Relationships? Identity? Credibility?

   _[Writing space]_

4. **What was your absolute lowest point?**
   - The moment you felt most defeated, broken, or hopeless.

   _[Writing space]_

### **Pages 8-9: PROMPT 2 - What Did You Learn?**

**Headline:** PROMPT 2: What Did You Learn?

**Subheadline:** Extract the wisdom buried in the pain. What did this teach you that success never could?

**Guidance Copy:**
```
Now for the reframe.

Research shows: "We hurt where we care, and we care where we hurt."

Your pain points to what you value. The lessons from failure are often more valuable
than the lessons from success.

This isn't about minimizing what happened. It's about extracting the wisdom that came
FROM what happened.

What did this experience teach you that you wouldn't have learned any other way?
```

**Prompts:**

1. **What did this failure teach you about yourself?**
   - What did you discover about your character, values, or capabilities?

   _[Writing space]_

2. **What beliefs had to die for you to grow?**
   - What illusions were shattered? What naive assumptions were corrected?

   _[Writing space]_

3. **What did you learn that success never could have taught you?**
   - Resilience? Humility? Empathy? Strategic thinking? Financial wisdom?

   _[Writing space]_

4. **What was the hidden gift in this pain?**
   - Looking back now, what unexpected benefit came from this experience?

   _[Writing space]_

5. **How has this pain pointed you toward what you truly value?**
   - What does the location of your pain reveal about what matters most to you?

   _[Writing space]_

### **Pages 10-11: PROMPT 3 - How Has It Made You Stronger?**

**Headline:** PROMPT 3: How Has It Made You Stronger?

**Subheadline:** Identify the specific strengths, skills, and resilience you developed through this experience.

**Guidance Copy:**
```
You survived something that could have destroyed you.

That survival isn't passive. It required you to develop new capabilities.

Research on post-traumatic growth shows that resilience isn't just "bouncing back"—
it's being transformed through adversity. You're not the same person you were before
this happened. You're stronger in specific, measurable ways.

This prompt helps you inventory those strengths.
```

**Prompts:**

1. **What specific strengths did you develop that you didn't have before?**
   - Emotional resilience? Financial discipline? Strategic thinking? Empathy?

   _[Writing space]_

2. **What can you do now that you couldn't do before this experience?**
   - New skills? New perspectives? New capacities?

   _[Writing space]_

3. **When have you already demonstrated resilience in the face of this challenge?**
   - Identify the moments you DIDN'T let this destroy you. What does that reveal?

   _[Writing space]_

4. **How are you wiser, more capable, or more compassionate because of what you went through?**

   _[Writing space]_

5. **If this experience were part of your "hero's journey," what gift did you bring back from the underworld?**
   - What treasure did you extract from the darkness?

   _[Writing space]_

### **Pages 12-13: PROMPT 4 - Who Does This Wisdom Help You Serve?**

**Headline:** PROMPT 4: Who Does This Wisdom Help You Serve?

**Subheadline:** Discover how your pain points to your purpose. Who needs what you learned?

**Guidance Copy:**
```
Here's where your redemptive story becomes strategic.

Research shows that people who frame their stories redemptively demonstrate higher
"generativity"—concern for and commitment to helping future generations.

Your pain wasn't just FOR you. It was for the people you're uniquely qualified to help
BECAUSE of what you went through.

This is how your mess becomes your message.
```

**Prompts:**

1. **Who is struggling with what you struggled with?**
   - Who is where you used to be?

   _[Writing space]_

2. **What do you know now that they desperately need to know?**
   - What wisdom could shortcut their suffering?

   _[Writing space]_

3. **How does your painful experience make you uniquely qualified to serve specific people?**
   - Who can you help BECAUSE of what you went through?

   _[Writing space]_

4. **What would you tell your past self if you could go back to your lowest point?**
   - This is often the exact message your ideal client needs to hear.

   _[Writing space]_

5. **How could your story give someone else hope?**
   - Who needs to know that comeback is possible?

   _[Writing space]_

This is the story you can use:
• On your "About" page

### **Page 16: How to Use Your Redemptive Story**

**Headline:** How to Use Your Story Strategically

**Subheadline:** Your story isn't just therapy. It's strategy.

**Body Copy:**

**1. IN YOUR MARKETING (Build Trust and Authority)**
- Use your story on your website "About" page
- Share it in your email welcome sequence
- Reference it in social media content
- Make it the foundation of your brand positioning

**Why it works:** Research shows 92% of people trust individuals over companies. Your vulnerable, authentic story builds instant trust.

**2. IN YOUR CONTENT (Connect With Your Audience)**
- Reference elements of your story in blog posts, videos, and social content
- Use "I used to believe X, but after Y, I learned Z" framework
- Share lessons from your journey to provide value

**Why it works:** People buy from people they know, like, and trust. Your story creates connection.

**3. IN YOUR BRAND (Differentiate Yourself)**
- Your redemptive story is what makes you different from every other coach/entrepreneur
- It positions you as the guide who's walked the path (StoryBrand framework)
- It creates "authority through service"—you're qualified BECAUSE you survived this

**Why it works:** 74% of consumers trust someone with a respected personal brand. Your story builds that brand.

**4. IN YOUR LIFE (Remind Yourself How Far You've Come)**
- Reread this when you feel like an impostor
- Remember: your past isn't a liability, it's your proof
- You're not broken. You're battle-tested.

**Why it works:** The story you tell yourself shapes your future. Redemptive narratives increase psychological well-being and life satisfaction.

### **Page 17: The Science Behind Redemptive Stories**

**Headline:** Why This Works: The Research

**Body Copy:**

**NARRATIVE PSYCHOLOGY (Dan McAdams, Northwestern University)**
People who tell more redemptive stories score significantly higher on measures of psychological well-being, life satisfaction, and "generativity" (concern for future generations).

**CULTURAL PREFERENCE (University of Michigan Research)**
Redemptive stories are a "cultural master narrative" in the U.S.—people reliably prefer stories that are redeemed vs. stories that end negatively, and they judge narrators of redemptive stories as more likable.

**HERO'S JOURNEY (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology)**
Eight studies show that perceiving your life as a Hero's Journey predicts and can causally increase people's experience of meaning in life, well-being, and reduced depression.

**POST-TRAUMATIC GROWTH (Resilience Research)**
Trauma reframing builds self-compassion, recognizes strengths, and helps people integrate painful experiences into coherent life narratives.

**THE BOTTOM LINE:**
The way you tell your story literally changes your psychological outcomes, how others perceive you, and your sense of meaning and purpose.

This isn't just feel-good fluff. This is science-backed transformation.

## PSYCHOLOGICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES APPLIED

**1. COMPLETION-PROBLEM EFFECT (Research-Backed)**
- Provide examples before asking users to complete exercises
- Pages 3-4 show completed redemptive stories (Jobs, Blakely, Disney, Oprah)
- This models the framework before users apply it themselves

**2. PROGRESS VISUALIZATION**
- Each prompt page shows "Prompt X of 5" with visual progress bar
- Celebrates completion: "✓ Prompt 1 Complete! You're 20% there."

**3. QUICK WINS FIRST**
- Prompt 1 (naming the experience) is easier than Prompt 5 (writing full story)
- Scaffolded difficulty builds momentum

**4. EXTERNALIZATION LANGUAGE**
- Prompts use "What happened to you" vs. "What did you do"
- Separates person from problem (narrative therapy principle)

**5. HOPEFUL, FORWARD-FOCUSED TONE**
- Design aesthetic is redemptive (sunrise, not darkness)
- Language emphasizes "who you're becoming" not "what happened to you"
