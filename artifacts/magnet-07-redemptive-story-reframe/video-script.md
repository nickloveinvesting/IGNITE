## FULL VIDEO SCRIPT

### **[0:00-0:20] HOOK - The Problem**

**[CAMERA: Direct to camera, close-up, serious but warm]**

**SCRIPT:**

"You've failed. You've lost money. You've been through something painful—a bankruptcy, a divorce, a failed business, maybe addiction or a public humiliation that you still carry shame about.

And you think that disqualifies you from success.

You see other entrepreneurs with perfect backstories and you think, 'Who am I to teach anyone anything? Look at my mess.'

**I'm going to show you why you're wrong.**"

---

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT OVERLAY]**
- "Your past doesn't disqualify you. It qualifies you."

---

**[B-ROLL SUGGESTIONS]**
- Person looking defeated, head in hands
- Closed business sign
- Stack of bills/debt
- Person deleting social media post (hiding their story)

---

### **[0:20-1:10] THE TRUTH - Redemptive Stories Are Everywhere**

**[CAMERA: Medium shot, more relaxed posture, conversational]**

**SCRIPT:**

"Here's what most people don't realize: **every successful person has a redemptive story.**

Steve Jobs? Fired from Apple, the company he founded. Publicly humiliated. He came back 12 years later and created the iPhone.

Sara Blakely? Failed the LSAT twice. Rejected from law school. Sold fax machines door-to-door. She turned $5,000 into Spanx and became a billionaire.

Walt Disney? Fired from a newspaper for 'lack of imagination.' His first animation company went bankrupt. He went on to build the most imaginative brand in history.

Oprah Winfrey? Survived childhood abuse. Fired from her TV job as an evening news anchor. She became one of the most influential people in the world.

**Your failure isn't the end of your story. It's the beginning of your comeback.**"

---

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT OVERLAY - QUICK CUTS]**
- "Steve Jobs: Fired → iPhone"
- "Sara Blakely: Failed LSAT → Billionaire"
- "Walt Disney: Bankrupt → Disney Empire"
- "Oprah: Fired → Media Mogul"

---

**[B-ROLL SUGGESTIONS]**
- Photos/videos of Jobs, Blakely, Disney, Oprah
- Timeline graphics showing their failures and successes
- Transition to phoenix rising or sunrise imagery

---

### **[1:10-1:50] THE REFRAME - Pain as Qualification**

**[CAMERA: Close-up, intimate, vulnerable]**

**SCRIPT:**

"Here's the truth most coaches won't tell you:

**Your painful past isn't a liability. It's your qualification.**

Think about it:

That bankruptcy? It taught you financial discipline that people born into wealth will never learn.

That addiction? It taught you resilience and empathy that 'perfect' people don't have.

That divorce? It taught you how to rebuild from zero.

That failed business? It taught you lessons that success never could.

The people you're meant to serve don't want a guru who's never struggled.

**They want someone who's been where they are. Someone who knows the way out.**

That's you."

---

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT OVERLAY]**
- "Your pain taught you what success never could."

---

**[B-ROLL SUGGESTIONS]**
- Person writing in journal (reflective, transformative moment)
- Sunrise/new beginning imagery
- Someone helping another person climb up (metaphor for guide)

---

### **[1:50-3:30] THE FRAMEWORK - The 5-Prompt System**

**[CAMERA: Medium shot, more instructional tone, confident]**

**SCRIPT:**

"So how do you actually reframe your painful past into your most powerful story?

I created a framework called the **Redemptive Story Reframe.** It's based on 30 years of narrative psychology research showing that people who tell redemptive stories—stories that transition from pain to growth—have significantly higher well-being, life satisfaction, and sense of purpose.

**The way you tell your story literally changes who you become.**

It's five prompts. You can complete it in 60 minutes. And by the end, you'll have your signature story—the foundation of your brand.

Here's how it works:"

---

**[ON-SCREEN GRAPHIC: Show the 5 prompts visually as they're explained]**

---

**PROMPT 1: What Painful Experience Shaped You?**

"First, you name it. The thing you've been hiding. The failure, the loss, the shame. You write it down in detail—what happened, how it felt, what you lost.

This is the hardest part. But you can't reframe what you won't face."

---

**PROMPT 2: What Did You Learn?**

"Second, you extract the wisdom. What did this experience teach you that success never could? What beliefs had to die for you to grow? What was the hidden gift in this pain?

Research shows: *we hurt where we care, and we care where we hurt.* Your pain points to what you value."

---

**PROMPT 3: How Has It Made You Stronger?**

"Third, you inventory your strengths. What specific capabilities did you develop because of this experience? Resilience? Empathy? Strategic thinking? Financial discipline?

You survived something that could have destroyed you. That survival required you to become stronger. This prompt helps you see exactly how."

---

**PROMPT 4: Who Does This Wisdom Help You Serve?**

"Fourth, you connect pain to purpose. Who is struggling with what you struggled with? What do you know now that they desperately need to know? How does your painful experience make you uniquely qualified to serve specific people?

**Your mess becomes your message. Your test becomes your testimony.**"

---

**PROMPT 5: Your Redemptive Story (The Reframe)**

"Finally, you write your complete story using the five-part framework: The Fall, The Lesson, The Rising, The Transformation, and The Mission.

This becomes your signature story. The one you use on your website, in your marketing, in your sales conversations, everywhere."

---

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT - KEY POINTS]**
- Prompt 1: Name the Pain
- Prompt 2: Extract the Wisdom
- Prompt 3: Inventory Your Strengths
- Prompt 4: Connect Pain to Purpose
- Prompt 5: Write Your Redemptive Story

---

**[B-ROLL SUGGESTIONS]**
- Show worksheet pages/prompts on screen
- Graphics illustrating the 5-step journey (visual diagram)
- Someone writing, moment of realization/breakthrough
- Transformation imagery (caterpillar to butterfly, etc.)

### **[3:30-4:30] HOW TO USE YOUR STORY - Strategic Application**

**[CAMERA: Medium shot, energetic, tactical]**

**SCRIPT:**

"Now, here's what makes this different from therapy or journaling:

**This is strategy.**

Your redemptive story isn't just for healing—it's for building your brand.

Once you've reframed your story, here's how you use it:

**1. In your marketing.** Your 'About' page, your social media bio, your email welcome sequence. Your story builds instant trust. Research shows 92% of people trust individuals over companies. Your vulnerability is your competitive advantage.

**2. In your content.** Reference your story in blog posts, videos, social content. Use the 'I used to believe this, but after this experience, I learned this' framework. It creates connection.

**3. In your brand positioning.** Your redemptive story is what differentiates you from every other coach or entrepreneur. It positions you as the guide who's walked the path. The one with credibility because you survived the struggle.

**4. In your life.** When you feel like an impostor, reread your story. Remember how far you've come. Your past isn't a liability—it's proof you can overcome anything.

The top 1% of entrepreneurs own their redemptive stories. The other 99% hide them.

**Which group are you in?**"

**[ON-SCREEN TEXT OVERLAY]**

**[B-ROLL SUGGESTIONS]**
- Website "About" page mockup with redemptive story
- Social media posts with story elements
- Someone confidently presenting/speaking
- Community/connection imagery

---

### **[4:30-5:15] THE SCIENCE - Why This Works**

**[CAMERA: Close-up, authoritative but accessible]**

**SCRIPT:**

"You might be thinking, 'This sounds nice, but does it actually work?'

Here's the research:

**Northwestern University:** People who tell more redemptive stories score significantly higher on psychological well-being, life satisfaction, and what researchers call 'generativity'—concern for helping future generations.

**University of Michigan:** Redemptive stories are what's called a 'cultural master narrative.' People reliably prefer redemptive stories and judge the people who tell them as more likable and trustworthy.

**Journal of Personality and Social Psychology:** Seeing your life as a hero's journey—which is essentially what a redemptive story is—can causally increase your experience of meaning in life, well-being, and reduce depression.

**The bottom line?** The way you tell your story changes your psychological outcomes, how others perceive you, and your sense of purpose.

This isn't motivational fluff. This is science-backed transformation."
