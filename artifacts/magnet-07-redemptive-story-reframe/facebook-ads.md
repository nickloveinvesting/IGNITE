## AD #1: THE CONFRONTATION
**Angle:** Direct, challenging hook that confronts the shame story

---

### **PRIMARY TEXT (Above Image/Video):**

The thing you're most ashamed of is probably your superpower.

You've been through something painful. Maybe it's:

• A failed business that cost you everything
• Bankruptcy that destroyed your credit
• Addiction you thought would ruin you
• A divorce that left you starting over
• A public failure you still can't shake

You think it disqualifies you from success.

**It doesn't. It qualifies you.**

Steve Jobs was fired from Apple. Sara Blakely failed the LSAT. Walt Disney went bankrupt.

Your painful past isn't a liability—it's the exact experience that makes you credible, relatable, and powerful.

The people who need your help don't want a guru who's never struggled. They want someone who's been in the pit and climbed out.

---

### **PRIMARY TEXT:**

Steve Jobs was fired.
Sara Blakely failed the LSAT.
Walt Disney went bankrupt.
Oprah Winfrey was told she'd never make it in TV.

**Every successful person has a redemptive story.**

The difference between people who stay stuck and people who build empires?

**One group hides their failures. The other group owns them.**

Your painful past—the thing you're ashamed of—is exactly what makes you credible.

The bankruptcy taught you financial discipline.
The addiction taught you resilience and empathy.
The divorce taught you how to rebuild from zero.
The failed business taught you what success never could.

The people you're meant to serve don't need a perfect guru.

**They need someone who's been where they are.**

That's you.

## AD #3: THE PAIN-TO-PURPOSE REFRAME
**Angle:** Emotional vulnerability, permission to transform shame into strength

---

### **PRIMARY TEXT:**

You've been hiding your story.

The bankruptcy. The addiction. The divorce. The failed business. The public humiliation.

You think if people knew the truth, they'd judge you. They'd see you as broken. Disqualified.

So you edit your bio. You avoid talking about those years. You carry it as shame.

**Here's what no one tells you:**

**The thing you're hiding is the exact thing that makes you powerful.**

Not in spite of what you went through.
*Because* of what you went through.

Your pain taught you what success never could:
- Resilience (you survived what could have destroyed you)
- Empathy (you know what rock bottom feels like)
- Wisdom (you learned lessons most people never will)
- Credibility (you've been where your clients are)

**We hurt where we care. And we care where we hurt.**

Your pain points to your purpose.

The people you're meant to serve don't want a coach who's never struggled. They want someone who's been in the pit, climbed out, and knows the way.

**That's you.**

**Download the free Redemptive Story Reframe worksheet and transform your painful past into your most powerful marketing asset.**

60 minutes. 5 prompts. Your complete signature story.

✓ Reframe shame into strength
✓ Extract wisdom from pain
✓ Discover who you're meant to serve because of what you survived
✓ Write your redemptive narrative (the foundation of your brand)

**Your past doesn't disqualify you. It qualifies you.**
