## EMAIL BODY

**Subject**: What Happened When James Did This Exercise

---

Hi [FirstName],

I want to show you what's possible when someone actually does this work.

---

REAL EXAMPLE:

Meet James (name changed for privacy).

He came in feeling stuck. Good job. $120K salary. Completely unfulfilled.

**His Pain Column:**

- "My job has cost me 7 years of career momentum"
- "My perfectionism is keeping me from starting my business (afraid it won't be perfect)"
- "My isolation in decision-making (no counsel) is costing me opportunities"
- "My fear of failure has cost me $200K+ in untaken opportunities"

**His Vision Column:**

- "I'm launching my business within 6 months"
- "I'm building a mastermind (3 strategic advisors I trust)"
- "I'm making decisions from possibility, not fear"
- "I'm choosing work I actually care about"

---

WHAT HAPPENED NEXT:

He read that ledger every morning for 28 days.

Then he started IGNITE (which goes deeper into mechanism + accountability).

**30 days in**: He'd had 4 conversations with potential business partners. Things were moving.

**60 days in**: He'd given notice at his job. His business had its first 3 clients.

**90 days in**: He was working full-time on his business. Income: $8K that first month. Stress level: Cut in half. Life satisfaction: Off the charts.

Was it perfect? No.

Was it faster than trying to figure it out alone? Absolutely.

Because he wasn't operating on hope. He was operating on INTENTION.

---

THE PATTERN:

We see this over and over.

People who do the Pain & Vision work → then commit to deeper work (like IGNITE) → move faster and with more confidence than people who try to "figure it out."

The ledger is just the start.

IGNITE takes it to the next level: daily practice, community accountability, weekly coaching.

---

HERE'S MY INVITATION:

If you've done the ledger and you're feeling the shift, you're ready for the next step.

I want to offer you a free **20-minute Strategy Call** where we:

- Review your specific stuck patterns (from your ledger)
- Show you what's possible in 90 days for someone in your exact situation
- Determine if IGNITE is right for you right now

This isn't a hard sell. If we don't think you're ready, we'll tell you.

But if you are ready, we want you in.

**Ready to talk?**

Talk soon,

Toby Potter
Founder, IGNITE

P.S. Don't overthink this. You already know you're stuck. The question is just: Are you ready to do something about it?
