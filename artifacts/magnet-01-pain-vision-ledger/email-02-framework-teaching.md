**Subject**: Why This Simple Exercise Changes Everything

---

Hi [FirstName],

I want to make sure you actually DID the exercise (not just read about it).

Because reading about your pain and WRITING DOWN your pain are two completely different experiences.

---

HERE'S THE PSYCHOLOGY:

When you're thinking about your costs, they feel abstract. "I'm stuck. This job isn't fulfilling. I'm wasting time."

But when you WRITE them down specifically, your brain activates differently.

Instead of abstract anxiety, you have concrete evidence:

- "This role has cost me $150K in the last 5 years"
- "My fear of failure kept me from starting my business"
- "My perfectionism has cost me my marriage—no real conversations in 2 years"

See the difference? One is vague. One is undeniable.

The moment you see it written down, your nervous system shifts. You can't un-see it.

---

THEN THE RIGHT SIDE BECOMES URGENT:

Once you've named the cost, the right column (THE VISION) becomes magnetic.

You're not just dreaming. You're CHOOSING DIFFERENTLY.

"I'm investing 2 hours weekly in my business, period."

"I'm having one real conversation with my family every week, phone-free."

"I'm saying no to projects that don't align with my 5-year vision."

These aren't hopes. They're decisions. Pre-commitments.

And when you read them every morning, your subconscious starts aligning your actions with your commitments.

---

THAT'S THE MECHANISM:

**Clarity** (seeing the cost)
+
**Commitment** (written)
+
**Repetition** (daily reading)
=
**Transformation**

This is Day 1 of IGNITE's approach.

There are 27 more days designed to deepen this.

Each day builds on the foundation you're creating right now.

---

WHAT'S NEXT:

If you filled out the ledger and felt the shift, you're ready for what comes next.

Tomorrow I'm sending you something specific about what changes when people actually commit (with real examples).

---

Talk soon,

Toby Potter
Founder, IGNITE

P.S. If you haven't filled it out yet, do it tonight. Don't wait. The insight you get is time-sensitive.
