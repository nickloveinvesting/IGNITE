## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Setup (Week 1)
1. Review WEEK-1-SETUP.md
2. Set up platforms (Leadpages, ESP, Facebook Ads)
3. Build first 2 magnets
4. Complete DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md for each
5. Launch and monitor using TRACKING-DASHBOARD.md

### Phase 2: Optimize (Week 2)
1. Review WEEK-2-OPTIMIZATION.md
2. Analyze Week 1 performance
3. Implement optimizations
4. Build magnets #3-5
5. Adjust budget allocation

### Phase 3: Scale (Week 3-4)
1. Review WEEK-3-SCALING.md
2. Complete remaining magnets
3. Identify top performers
4. Scale advertising budget
5. Plan Month 2 strategy

### Ongoing: Monitor & Troubleshoot
1. Check TRACKING-DASHBOARD.md daily
2. Reference TROUBLESHOOTING.md when issues arise
3. Optimize based on data
4. Document lessons learned
