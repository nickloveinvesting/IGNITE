3. Logic: Quiz result → Add corresponding tag in ESP
4. Create 5 separate automations (one per archetype)
5. Load email copy from `email-sequences.md`
6. Schedule emails (immediate, Day 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12)
7. Test each sequence with test email addresses

### Step 4: Create Facebook Ads (60-90 min)

### Step 5: Optimization (Ongoing)
- Track metrics: Quiz completion rate (target: 70%+), email capture rate (target: 60%+), IGNITE conversions
- A/B test: Landing page headlines, quiz questions, email subject lines
- Scale: Increase ad budget on best-performing ads

### Success Metrics (30-Day Targets)
