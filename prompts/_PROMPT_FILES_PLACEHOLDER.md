## What Goes in Each File

Each prompt file (01-10) should be a complete, standalone markdown file containing:

1. **Header** (Role definition, context)
2. **Brand Guidelines** (IGNITE colors, fonts, voice)
3. **Research Instructions** (3-agent system)
4. **Artifact Generation Instructions** (All 6 artifacts)
5. **Quality Standards** (Brand alignment, conversion optimization)

**Average prompt length:** 5,000-10,000 words per prompt

## How to Add Prompt Files

When you create the actual prompt files:

1. Use `/templates/PROMPT-TEMPLATE.md` as starting point
2. Customize for specific magnet (audience, problem, format)
3. Include all brand specifications
4. Add research instructions
5. Detail all 6 artifact requirements
6. Test by generating artifacts in Claude
7. Refine based on output quality
8. Save as `[NUMBER]-[NAME].md` in this folder
