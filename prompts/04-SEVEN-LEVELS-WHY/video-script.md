### [0:00-0:30] HOOK - The Problem

**[ON SCREEN: You, looking directly at camera]**

**YOU:**
"Your why is too shallow.

I know that sounds harsh—but if you're driven by money, status, achievement, or even 'freedom'... your motivation is surface-level. And the research shows that surface motivation leads to burnout, decision paralysis, and achieving goals that leave you feeling empty.

In the next 6 minutes, I'm going to show you exactly how to move from surface motivation—which is fragile and unsustainable—to identity-level motivation, which is unshakable and unstoppable.

This is the 7-Levels-Deep Why framework. And it changes everything."

### [0:30-1:00] CREDIBILITY - Why You Should Listen

**YOU:**
"Quick intro: I'm [Your Name], and I've spent [X years] coaching entrepreneurs and high-achievers. I've watched thousands of people go through this exercise, and here's what I've seen:

The people who complete all 7 levels? They make decisions faster. They push through obstacles. They build businesses and lives that actually fulfill them.

The people who stop at Level 1-2? They stay stuck. They chase goals that don't matter. And they burn out.

This framework is based on research from USC's Identity-Based Motivation Theory, Self-Determination Theory, and over a decade of real-world application.

It works. Let me show you how."

### [1:00-2:00] FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW - The 7 Levels

**[SCREEN SHARE: Visual diagram of 7 levels - pyramid or staircase]**

**YOU:**
"Here's how the framework works. There are 7 levels of motivation, from surface to soul:

**Level 1:** External Outcomes - Money, status, achievement
**Level 2:** Practical Benefits - What the outcome gives you
**Level 3:** Feelings & Experiences - How you want to feel
**Level 4:** Identity & Self-Perception - Who you become
**Level 5:** Core Values - What you stand for
**Level 6:** Life Meaning & Purpose - Your contribution
**Level 7:** Unshakable Identity-Core - Your deepest truth

Most people stop at Level 1 or 2. Some get to Level 3.

But the transformation—the real breakthrough—happens at Levels 5, 6, and 7.

That's where you find bedrock. That's where motivation becomes unshakable."

**[GRAPHIC OVERLAY: Levels 1-3 labeled "Surface (Fragile)" | Levels 5-7 labeled "Deep (Unshakable)"]**

### [2:00-3:30] SURFACE VS. DEEP - Why This Matters

**[BACK TO TALKING HEAD]**

**YOU:**
"Let me show you why this matters with research.

**STAT #1:** People with identity-based motivation report 2.8 times higher satisfaction than those driven by external rewards.

**STAT #2:** When people create implementation intentions based on their deep why, they have a 91% follow-through rate—compared to only 53% with surface goals.

**STAT #3:** Values alignment protects against burnout. Research shows that when your daily actions match your core values, you experience significantly less emotional exhaustion.

Here's the bottom line: Surface motivation is unsustainable. Deep motivation is unstoppable.

And the difference? 7 questions.

You start with a surface desire—'I want to make more money'—and you ask 'Why is this important to me?' seven times.

Each time you ask, you go one level deeper. By the seventh answer, you've reached your identity-core—the unshakable foundation that most people never discover.

Let me walk you through it."

**[GRAPHIC OVERLAY: "91% follow-through | 2.8x satisfaction | Burnout protection"]**

### [3:30-6:30] LEVEL-BY-LEVEL WALKTHROUGH

**[SCREEN SHARE: Worksheet visible]**

**YOU:**
"Okay, let's do this. I'm going to walk you through all 7 levels using a real example.

Let's say your starting point is: 'I want to grow my business to $1 million in revenue.'

That's your surface goal. Now we dig.

---

**LEVEL 1: External Outcomes**

Ask yourself: 'Why do I want this? What will it give me?'

You might answer: 'So I can make more money and prove I'm successful.'

Write that down. That's Level 1—external outcomes. It's all about the tangible result.

But don't stop here. Keep going.

---

**LEVEL 2: Practical Benefits**

Now ask: 'Why is THAT important to me? What will making more money allow me to do?'

You might answer: 'So I can afford a better house, travel more, and provide for my family without stress.'

That's Level 2—practical benefits. You're getting closer, but you're still in the external zone.

Keep going.

---

**LEVEL 3: Feelings & Experiences**

Ask again: 'Why do I want to feel financially secure and provide for my family?'

You might answer: 'So I can feel like a good father/mother. So I can feel safe and not worry about money.'

That's Level 3—feelings and experiences. This is where most people have their first mini-breakthrough.

But we're not done yet. The real why is deeper.

---

**LEVEL 4: Identity & Self-Perception**

Here's where it gets interesting. Ask: 'Who do I BECOME when I achieve this? What does this say about who I am?'

You might answer: 'I am someone who takes care of the people I love. I am a provider and protector.'

Notice the shift? You moved from 'I want to feel...' to 'I AM...'

That's identity-based motivation. And research shows this is where transformation begins.

But we're not at bedrock yet. Two more levels.

---

**LEVEL 5: Core Values**

Ask: 'What VALUES does being a provider and protector represent?'

You might answer: 'Family, security, responsibility, and legacy.'

Write those down. These are your core values—the principles that drive behavior across all areas of your life.

This is deep. But there's one more layer.

---

**LEVEL 6: Life Meaning & Purpose**

Ask: 'How does this connect to my life's PURPOSE? What impact does this have beyond me?'

You might answer: 'To break generational patterns of financial instability and create a legacy of security for my kids and their kids.'

Now we're talking about contribution. Purpose. Impact beyond yourself.

You're almost there. One more level.

---

**LEVEL 7: Unshakable Identity-Core**

Final question: 'At my very core, who am I in relation to this? What is the deepest truth this reveals?'

You might answer: 'At my core, I am a builder and a breaker of chains. I create what didn't exist and end what shouldn't continue. I transform what I was given into what's needed.'

**[PAUSE FOR EMPHASIS]**

Read that out loud. Does it give you chills? Does it feel unshakably true?

That's Level 7. That's your identity-core.

THAT'S what you build from."

**[GRAPHIC OVERLAY: "Level 7: Your Unshakable Foundation"]**

### [6:30-7:30] IMPLEMENTATION - What To Do Next

**[BACK TO TALKING HEAD]**

**YOU:**
"Okay, so you've gone 7 levels deep. You've discovered your identity-core.

Now what?

Here's what happens next:

**STEP 1:** Use your Level 7 identity as a decision filter.

Every opportunity, every commitment, every choice—ask: 'Does this honor my Level 7 identity?'

If YES, pursue it. If NO, decline it. It's that simple.

**STEP 2:** Turn your core values into daily actions.

Take your 3 core values from Level 5 and create one small daily action for each.

Example: If 'family' is a core value, your action might be 'phone-free dinner 3 nights a week.'

Make it specific. When, where, how.

Research shows that when you create implementation intentions, your follow-through rate goes from 53% to 91%.

**STEP 3:** Revisit this exercise every 90 days.

As you grow, your clarity deepens. Your Level 7 answer becomes sharper, more precise.

This isn't a one-time exercise. It's a practice.

And that's how surface motivation becomes unshakable clarity."
