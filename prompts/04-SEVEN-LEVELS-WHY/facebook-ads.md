# AD VARIATION #1: SURFACE VS. DEEP (Pattern Interrupt)

## Ad Copy:

```
Your "why" is too shallow.

(I know that sounds harsh—but hear me out.)

Most entrepreneurs are driven by surface motivation:
→ Make more money
→ Achieve freedom
→ Build status

But research shows surface motivation leads to:
❌ Burnout
❌ Decision paralysis
❌ Achieving goals that feel empty

The solution? Go 7 levels deep.

I created a free framework that takes you from surface desires (money, status) to identity-level clarity (your unshakable core).

It takes 20-30 minutes.

And it changes everything.

✅ 2.8x higher satisfaction when motivation is identity-based
✅ 91% follow-through when connected to deep why
✅ Significant protection against burnout

Thousands of entrepreneurs have used this to:
→ Make decisions with crystal clarity (no more second-guessing)
→ Build businesses aligned with who they actually are
→ Wake up knowing exactly why they're doing what they're doing

# AD VARIATION #2: PROBLEM-SOLUTION (Empathy-Driven)

## Ad Copy:

```
You're achieving goals but still feel empty.

You know WHAT you're doing... but not WHY you're really doing it.

Sound familiar?

That's the problem with surface motivation.

You're chasing:
→ Money (but it never feels like enough)
→ Freedom (but you're more stressed than ever)
→ Success (but something still feels missing)

Here's what I've learned after working with 1,000+ entrepreneurs:

The goals aren't wrong. The motivation is too shallow.

When you're driven by external outcomes (Level 1-2 motivation), you:
❌ Burn out easily
❌ Second-guess every decision
❌ Feel like you're building someone else's dream

But when you discover your identity-level why (Level 7 motivation), you:
✅ Make decisions instantly (crystal-clear filter)
✅ Push through obstacles (because this is WHO YOU ARE)
✅ Build a life that actually fulfills you

I created a free framework to take you from surface to soul-level clarity.

It's called the 7-Levels-Deep Why Excavator.

20-30 minutes of focused work.
7 simple questions.
One life-changing breakthrough.

Here's what you get:
→ Interactive worksheet (all 7 levels mapped out)
→ 3-minute video explaining the science
→ 7-day email coaching sequence

The research backing this is solid:
→ 91% follow-through when motivation is identity-based
→ 2.8x higher satisfaction vs. surface motivation
→ Measurable burnout protection

## AD VARIATION #5: CURIOSITY-DRIVEN (Hook-Heavy)

**Copy:**

```
Ask yourself "why" 7 times.

That's it.

Sounds simple, right?

But here's what happens:

Level 1: You'll say something surface (money, freedom, status)
Level 2-3: You'll hit practical benefits and feelings
Level 4-5: You'll discover your identity and values
Level 6-7: You'll reach your unshakable core

By Level 7, most people cry.

Not because it's sad—because it's TRUE.

You finally understand what you've been searching for.

I created a free framework that guides you through all 7 levels.

## AD VARIATION #6: FEAR-OF-MISSING-OUT (FOMO)

**Copy:**

```
52% of professionals would take a PAY CUT to work in alignment with their values.

Think about that.

People would literally make LESS MONEY to do work that matters.

Why?

Because surface motivation (money, status, achievement) doesn't fulfill.

But values-aligned motivation? That changes everything.

The problem? Most people don't know what their values actually are.

They think they do. But they're operating from Level 1-2 motivation (surface desires).

The real breakthrough happens at Level 5-7:
→ Core values
→ Life purpose
→ Identity-core

I created a free 20-minute framework to get you there.

It's called the 7-Levels-Deep Why Excavator.

And it's backed by research from:
→ USC (Identity-Based Motivation)
→ Self-Determination Theory
→ 10+ years coaching entrepreneurs

What you get:
✓ Complete worksheet (all 7 levels)
✓ Video walkthrough
✓ Implementation template
✓ 7-day email coaching

The stats:
→ 91% follow-through (vs. 53% without clarity)
→ 2.8x higher satisfaction
→ Measurable burnout protection

# BUDGET ALLOCATION RECOMMENDATIONS

## Phase 1: Testing ($300-500 total)

- 3 ad variations x $20/day x 5 days = $300
- Identify winning variation
- Kill losers, double down on winner

## Phase 2: Scaling ($1,500-3,000/month)

- Winner #1: $50-100/day
- New variations testing: $20-30/day
- Retargeting: $10-20/day

## Phase 3: Optimization ($3,000-10,000/month)

- Proven winners: $100-300/day
- Lookalike expansion: $50-100/day
- Creative refresh testing: $30-50/day
- Retargeting: $20-40/day

**ROI Breakeven:** If average client value is $2,000 and 5% of leads convert to clients, you can afford up to $100 CPL ($2,000 x 5% = $100). With target CPL of $5-8, you have massive profit margin.
