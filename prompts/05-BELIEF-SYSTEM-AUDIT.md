### Personalized Result Reports (One per Category)

**Scarcity Beliefs Result:**

**Headline:** "Your Primary Limiting Belief: Scarcity"

**What This Means:**
"You operate from a belief that there's not enough - not enough money, opportunity, time, or success to go around. This creates anxiety, hoarding behavior, and prevents you from investing in yourself or taking calculated risks."

**How It's Sabotaging You:**
- You hesitate to invest in opportunities that could grow your wealth
- You operate from fear rather than abundance
- You see competition everywhere instead of collaboration
- You hold onto resources so tightly you can't use them strategically

**Where It Came From:**
- Childhood experiences of lack or financial stress
- Cultural/family messages about money being scarce
- Economic downturns or personal financial trauma
- Constant comparison to those who have more

**How to Rewrite This Belief:**
- New belief: "There is more than enough. Abundance is my natural state."
- Evidence collection: Track examples of abundance in your life
- Action step: Make one investment in yourself this week (course, coach, tool)
- Affirmation: "I operate from abundance, not scarcity."

**Next Steps with IGNITE:**
"IGNITE will help you systematically replace scarcity beliefs with abundance thinking through daily practices, community support, and belief-shifting exercises."

---

**Worthiness Beliefs Result:**

**Headline:** "Your Primary Limiting Belief: Unworthiness"

**What This Means:**
"Deep down, you don't believe you deserve success, wealth, or happiness. This causes unconscious self-sabotage right when things start going well."

**How It's Sabotaging You:**
- You push success away when it gets close
- You undercharge, under-ask, under-deliver on your own behalf
- You feel guilty when things go well
- You create problems to confirm your unworthiness

**Where It Came From:**
- Childhood messages about not being good enough
- Comparison to siblings or peers
- Internalized criticism from authority figures
- Cultural/religious beliefs about humility or suffering

**How to Rewrite This Belief:**
- New belief: "I am inherently worthy. I deserve success."
- Evidence collection: List your accomplishments and strengths
- Action step: Ask for what you want this week without apologizing
- Affirmation: "I am worthy of all good things."

**Next Steps with IGNITE:**
"IGNITE provides a supportive community and daily practices to rebuild your sense of worthiness and eliminate self-sabotage patterns."
