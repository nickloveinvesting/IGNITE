## NOTES

**Differentiation Focus:** This lead magnet fills a critical market gap. While belief worksheets and personality quizzes exist, no one is offering a behavior-based belief system audit with quantified alignment scoring and pattern-specific personalization at this level of sophistication.

**Conversion Advantage:** Quiz-based magnets outperform PDFs by 2-5x (40-50% vs. 3-10%). The interactive format, immediate personalized results, and built-in segmentation make this a high-converting funnel.

**Profitability:** With $3-8 CPL and 2-5% email-to-IGNITE conversion, this magnet becomes profitable at scale. Break-even occurs at just 1.7% conversion (conservative).

**Implementation Readiness:** All materials are production-ready. Can launch MVP in 2 weeks, full optimized version in 4-8 weeks.
