**Title:** How to Use the Seven Levels of Why Framework

**Opening (0:00-0:20)**
- "Most people quit because their 'why' is too weak. Today I'm going to show you how to find a 'why' so powerful, you'll never quit again."

- "You've heard 'start with why' before. But most people stop at the surface."
- "I want to make money. I want freedom. I want success."
- "Those aren't deep enough. When things get hard - and they will - those motivations won't be enough."

**The Solution (1:00-2:00)**
- "That's why I created the Seven Levels of Why framework."

  - Level 1: "I want to start a business." Why? "To make money."
  - Level 2: Why do you want money? "To be financially free."
  - Level 3: Why do you want financial freedom? "To quit my job."
  - Level 4: Why do you want to quit? "I hate feeling controlled."
  - Level 5: Why does feeling controlled bother you? "Because I watched my dad work a job he hated for 40 years."
  - Level 6: Why does that matter to you? "Because I don't want my kids to see me miserable like I saw him."
  - Level 7: Why is that your deepest truth? "Because I want to show them that life can be different. That they have a choice. That they're not trapped."
- "THAT is a level 7 why. That will get you through anything."

**How to Use the Workbook (4:00-5:00)**
