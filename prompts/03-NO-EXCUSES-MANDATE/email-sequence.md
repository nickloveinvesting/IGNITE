---

**EMAIL BODY:**

```
Hi [FirstName],

You downloaded the No Excuses Mandate worksheet.

Before you open it, I want you to understand something.

Most people read about their excuses and think: "Yeah, I do that."

But reading about an excuse doesn't stop it.

Writing it down? That's different.

When you write down:

• "My excuse is: I'm waiting for the perfect moment"
• "The cost is: 2 years lost on my business"
• "My mandate is: I start NOW, imperfectly, with no waiting"

...something shifts.

You've moved from vague ("I procrastinate") to specific ("Here's my mandate").

And specific mandates override excuses.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE GETTING:

→ The 1-page worksheet (print or digital)
→ 3 lines for your 3 biggest excuses
→ 3 lines for the cost of each
→ 3 lines for your counter-mandates
→ Commitment line (sign it, commit to 28 days)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WATCH THIS FIRST (5 minutes):

Before you fill out the worksheet, watch this quick video explaining WHY mandates work:

[WATCH: Why Mandates Override Excuses]
↑ 5-minute breakdown of the psychology

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

YOUR NEXT STEP:

Print it or fill it digitally. Doesn't matter which.

What matters: Write it, sign it, read it daily.

Your mandates will override your excuses if you commit to the daily reading.

Block 15 minutes right now. Complete the worksheet. Don't wait.

(Waiting is an excuse. You just downloaded a worksheet about stopping excuses. See the irony?)

Talk soon,

Toby Potter
IGNITE Personal Transformation

P.S. — If you complete the worksheet in the next 24 hours, reply to this email with your #1 mandate. I read every response. I'll send you something extra.
```

## EMAIL #2: TEACHING - HOW MANDATES WORK
**Send:** Day 1 (24 hours after opt-in)
**Purpose:** Explain mechanism, deepen understanding, reinforce commitment

---

**SUBJECT LINE OPTIONS** (Test these):

Primary: `Why Mandates Actually Override Excuses`

Alternates:
- `The Science Behind Your Mandate (It's Real)`
- `Your Brain on Excuses vs. Mandates`
- `Why This Works (Even When Motivation Fails)`

**PREVIEW TEXT:**
`I want to explain the mechanism so you understand why this works...`

---

**EMAIL BODY:**

```
Hi [FirstName],

I want to explain the mechanism so you understand why this works.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

YOUR BRAIN WORKS LIKE THIS:

In the moment when you're about to act (or not act), your excuse shows up.

"I don't have time."
"I'm not ready."
"I need more information."
"I'm afraid."

Your brain believes the excuse. It feels real. It stops you.

THAT'S NORMAL. That's how human brains work.

But here's what most people don't know:

You can pre-decide.

You can write a mandate BEFORE you're in the moment.

Then in the moment, when the excuse shows up, your mandate is stronger.

"I don't have time" vs. "I mandate 30 minutes daily, NO EXCEPTIONS"

The mandate wins.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY WRITTEN MANDATES ARE POWERFUL:

1. PRE-DECISION
You decided when you were clear, not when you were scared.

2. SPECIFICITY
Specific mandate (30 min daily) beats vague excuse (I don't have time).

3. WITNESS
Writing creates a witness—your own commitment.

4. FREQUENCY
Reading it daily reinforces the mandate.

5. IDENTITY
You become "someone with mandates," not "someone with excuses."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HERE'S THE RESEARCH:

Studies show that written commitments increase follow-through by 42%.

Add accountability (like this email sequence)? Follow-through jumps to 76%.

Make the commitment specific (not vague)? Success rate increases by 90%.

This isn't motivational fluff. This is psychology.

Source: Dr. Gail Matthews, Dominican University study of 267 participants

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THAT'S WHY THIS WORKS:

Most people try to fight excuses in the moment (motivation, willpower).

You're taking a different approach: Pre-decide with mandates.

Your mandate is decided NOW, when you're clear.

So in the moment, when resistance shows up, your mandate is already there.

You don't have to be strong in the moment.

Your mandate is strong.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HAVE YOU FILLED OUT YOUR WORKSHEET YET?

If not, do it today.

Be specific about your excuses (not generic).

Write mandates that are non-negotiable (not "I'll try to...").

Sign it.

Read it every morning for 28 days.

Your behavior will change.

Not because you're more disciplined.

But because your mandates are stronger than your excuses.

**Send:** Day 3 (72 hours after opt-in)

---

**SUBJECT LINE OPTIONS** (Test these):

Primary: `What Changed When James Wrote His Mandates`

Alternates:
- `[FirstName], Meet Someone Who Stopped Making Excuses`
- `From "I Don't Have Time" to $50K in Revenue`
- `What Happens When You Actually Do This`

**PREVIEW TEXT:**
`He was a high-achiever but chronic excuse-maker. Here's what happened...`

---

**EMAIL BODY:**

```
Hi [FirstName],

Meet James.

He was a high-achiever but chronic excuse-maker.

His excuses:
• "I don't have time" (for his business, for his health, for his family)
• "I'm waiting for the perfect moment" (to launch, to commit, to act)
• "I need more information" (analysis paralysis)

Sound familiar?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HIS MANDATES:

1. "I mandate 2 hours daily on my business, NO EXCEPTIONS"

2. "I mandate I start before the perfect moment"

3. "I mandate I move with 85% information"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT HAPPENED:

→ 30 days: He'd already logged 60 hours on his business (vs. 0 before)
→ 60 days: His first product was ready to launch
→ 90 days: He was generating revenue, for the first time

Was it because he became more motivated?

No. He used the same brain, same constraints, same life.

What changed: His mandates were stronger than his excuses.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MEET SARAH:

Her excuse: "I'm waiting for the perfect moment to launch my course."

Her mandate: "I mandate I start before I'm ready."

Result: Launched imperfectly in 14 days. Made her first $5K in the first week.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MEET MARCUS:

His excuse: "I'm not qualified for that leadership position."

His mandate: "I mandate I learn by doing, not by waiting."

Result: Applied. Got the role. Six-figure salary.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MEET RACHEL:

Her excuse: "I need more information before I build my product."

Her mandate: "I mandate I move with 85% clarity."

Result: Stopped researching. Started building. Product launched in 45 days.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT DO THEY HAVE IN COMMON?

They didn't wait to feel ready.

They didn't wait for perfect timing.

They didn't wait for certainty.

They wrote mandates. They committed. They acted.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

NOW IT'S YOUR TURN:

You have the worksheet.

You understand the mechanism.

You've seen the proof.

The question is: Will you actually do it?

Or will you accept another excuse?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IF YOU WANT MORE THAN A WORKSHEET:

This is what IGNITE is for.

→ Day 1-3: You identify excuses (Pain & Vision Ledger, Archetype, Mandates)
→ Day 4-28: You live your mandates (daily practice, accountability, coaching)
→ By day 28: Mandates are automatic. Excuses are quiet.
→ By day 90: Your life has changed.

Not because you're different.

But because you're no longer letting excuses run your decisions.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HERE'S WHAT IGNITE INCLUDES:

✓ 90-day transformation program
✓ Weekly 1-on-1 coaching calls
✓ Daily accountability check-ins
✓ Private community of action-takers (no excuse-makers allowed)
✓ Complete framework: Pain & Vision Ledger, Seven Levels Deep, Archetype Assessment, Mandate Builder, Execution System

## RE-ENGAGEMENT SEQUENCE (Day 7+)

If subscriber hasn't engaged with first 3 emails, send:

### Day 7: Wake-Up Email

**Subject:** `Did you give up already?`

**Body:**
```
[FirstName],

You downloaded the No Excuses Mandate worksheet 7 days ago.

You haven't filled it out yet.

I know because you haven't clicked any links. You haven't watched the video. You haven't scheduled a call.

And that's fine. You don't owe me anything.

But you do owe yourself the truth:

Is "I'll do it later" just another excuse?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Here's the thing about excuses:

They don't announce themselves as excuses.

They show up disguised as reasons.

"I'm too busy right now."
"I'll wait until things calm down."
"I need to think about it more."

But there's never a perfect time.

Things never "calm down."

You'll never stop thinking and just start doing—unless you decide to.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

So here's my challenge:

Block 15 minutes today.

Fill out the worksheet.

Reply to this email with your #1 mandate.

Or don't.

But if you don't, at least be honest about why.

[DOWNLOAD WORKSHEET]

Talk soon,

Toby

P.S. — This is the last email about the worksheet. If you're not ready, that's okay. But don't lie to yourself about it.
```

## COPYWRITING NOTES (TOBY VOICE APPLIED)

### What Makes This Voice Work:

1. **Direct Opening:** No "I hope this email finds you well" — straight to the point
2. **Challenge:** "Did you give up already?" — not coddling
3. **Truth-Telling:** "You haven't clicked any links" — direct observation
4. **Permission:** "You don't owe me anything" — removes pressure, increases action
5. **Pattern Interrupt:** Questions that make you think ("Is 'I'll do it later' just another excuse?")
6. **Short Sentences:** Creates urgency and clarity
7. **No Fluff:** Every sentence earns its place
8. **Empowering Close:** "Or don't. But if you don't, at least be honest..."

### What to Avoid:

- ❌ Corporate speak: "We hope you're enjoying our content"
- ❌ Excessive emojis: 🎉🎉🎉 (unless strategic)
- ❌ Hedging: "You might want to consider possibly..."
- ❌ Over-politeness: "If it's not too much trouble..."
- ❌ Vague CTAs: "Learn more" instead of "Download worksheet"
