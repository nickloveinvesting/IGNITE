## FULL VIDEO SCRIPT

### [0:00-0:15] HOOK - THE PROBLEM

**[OPEN: Toby direct to camera, serious but approachable]**

**TOBY:**
Look. I know why you're watching this.

You know what you need to do. You just don't do it.

You keep using the same excuses.

"I don't have time."
"I'm waiting for the perfect moment."
"I'm not ready yet."

And every day you accept these excuses, you stay stuck.

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "You know what to do. You just don't do it."]**

**TOBY (continued):**
Different year. Same life. Same regrets.

I'm going to show you how to change that.

---

### [0:16-1:00] THE INSIGHT - WHY EXCUSES WIN

**TOBY:**
Here's what most people don't understand about excuses:

They don't show up saying "Hi, I'm an excuse."

They show up disguised as *reasons*.

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Excuses disguise themselves as reasons"]**

**TOBY (continued):**
"I don't have time" *sounds* reasonable.

"I'm not ready yet" *feels* true.

"I need more information" *seems* responsible.

Your brain believes them.

And when your brain believes the excuse, it stops you from acting.

**[B-ROLL INSERT: Calendar pages flipping, clock ticking - representing time passing]**

**TOBY (voiceover):**
So you try to fight the excuse with willpower.

"Come on, just do it. Stop procrastinating. Be more disciplined."

But willpower is exhausting.

And excuses? They're always there. Waiting.

**[BACK TO TOBY ON CAMERA]**

**TOBY:**
That's why most people lose this fight.

You can't beat an excuse with willpower.

You need a mandate.

---

### [1:01-2:15] THE MECHANISM - HOW MANDATES WORK

**TOBY:**
Let me explain how this works.

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "THE OLD WAY vs. THE NEW WAY"]**

**TOBY (continued):**
**OLD WAY:**

The moment arrives. You need to take action.

Your excuse shows up: *"I don't have time right now."*

You try to argue: *"Yes I do, I should just push through..."*

But your brain is already convinced. The excuse feels real.

So you don't act.

You tell yourself, "I'll do it tomorrow."

Tomorrow comes. Same excuse. Same result.

**[PAUSE FOR EFFECT]**

**TOBY:**
**NEW WAY:**

BEFORE the moment arrives, you write a mandate.

Not a goal. Not an intention. A mandate.

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "MANDATE = Pre-Decision"]**

**TOBY (continued):**
Here's what a mandate looks like:

*"I mandate 30 minutes daily on this project, NO EXCEPTIONS."*

Not "I'll try to find time."

Not "I should make this a priority."

Not "When things calm down, I'll..."

A mandate.

Specific. Non-negotiable. Written.

**[B-ROLL INSERT: Hand writing mandate on paper, close-up]**

**TOBY (voiceover):**
Now when the moment arrives and your excuse shows up...

*"I don't have time"* versus *"I mandate 30 minutes daily, no exceptions"*

...your mandate is stronger.

**[BACK TO TOBY ON CAMERA]**

**TOBY:**
Why is it stronger?

Because you decided when you were clear.

Not when you were tired. Not when you were scared. Not when you were overwhelmed.

You pre-decided.

And that pre-decision overrides the excuse.

---

### [2:16-3:00] THE SCIENCE - WHY THIS WORKS

**TOBY:**
This isn't motivational theory. This is psychology.

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "THE RESEARCH"]**

**TOBY (continued):**
Dr. Gail Matthews at Dominican University studied 267 people.

Written goals? 42% more likely to achieve them.

Add specificity? Success rate jumps by 90%.

Add accountability? Follow-through rate hits 76%.

**[TEXT OVERLAY ON SCREEN:]**
- Written commitments: +42% success
- Specific goals: +90% success
- Accountability: 76% follow-through

**TOBY:**
That's why mandates work.

1. You write it down. (Commitment device)
2. You make it specific. (No wiggle room)
3. You read it daily. (Reinforcement + accountability to yourself)

**[PAUSE]**

**TOBY (continued):**
Your excuse is vague. Your mandate is specific.

Your excuse is optional. Your mandate is non-negotiable.

Your excuse changes based on how you feel. Your mandate doesn't care how you feel.

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Your mandate doesn't care how you feel"]**

**TOBY:**
That's why the mandate wins.

### [3:01-4:00] THE APPLICATION - HOW TO WRITE YOURS

**TOBY:**
Here's how you do this:

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "3 STEPS TO WRITE YOUR MANDATES"]**

**TOBY (continued):**
**STEP 1: Name your excuse. Be specific.**

Not "I procrastinate."

Be specific: *"I keep saying I don't have time to work on my business."*

**STEP 2: Calculate the cost.**

What is this excuse actually costing you?

10 hours a week? $150,000 a year? Your self-respect? Your relationship?

Be honest. Write it down.

**[B-ROLL INSERT: Person writing on worksheet, contemplative]**

**TOBY (voiceover):**
When you see the real cost, the excuse loses power.

**[BACK TO TOBY ON CAMERA]**

**TOBY:**
**STEP 3: Write the mandate that overrides the excuse.**

This is critical. Your mandate must be:

**Specific.** Not "I'll try to work on my business more."

But: *"I mandate 2 hours daily on my business, 6 days a week, 6-8am."*

**[TEXT OVERLAY: Examples of good mandates:]**
- "I mandate 30 min daily, NO EXCEPTIONS"
- "I start before I'm ready"
- "I move with 85% information"

**TOBY:**
See the difference?

Vague intention vs. clear mandate.

Your brain can argue with "I should work on my business."

Your brain can't argue with "2 hours daily, 6-8am, no exceptions."

**STEP 4: Sign it. Commit to 28 days.**

**[B-ROLL INSERT: Person signing worksheet]**

**TOBY (voiceover):**
Not forever. Not "I'll see how it goes."

28 days. Commit. Sign your name.

**[BACK TO TOBY ON CAMERA]**

**TOBY:**
**STEP 5: Read it every morning.**

This is the part most people skip.

Don't skip this.

Every morning, read your mandates out loud.

They get stronger every time you read them.

Your excuses get quieter.

---

### [4:01-4:45] THE CHALLENGE - CALL TO ACTION

**TOBY:**
So here's my challenge for you:

Download the No Excuses Mandate Builder.

It's a free 1-page worksheet.

**[B-ROLL INSERT: Worksheet mockup on screen]**

**TOBY (voiceover):**
It walks you through exactly what I just explained.

Three excuses. Three costs. Three mandates.

**[BACK TO TOBY ON CAMERA]**

**TOBY:**
Block 15 minutes today. Not tomorrow. Today.

Fill it out.

Sign it.

Read it every morning for 28 days.

**[PAUSE, DIRECT EYE CONTACT]**

**TOBY (continued):**
I'm not going to tell you this is easy.

Facing your excuses is uncomfortable.

Writing them down? That makes them real.

Committing to mandates? That means you can't hide anymore.

But here's the truth:

Your excuses are already costing you.

You're already uncomfortable.

You're just not getting the results.

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Your excuses are already costing you"]**

**TOBY:**
Mandates won't make your life easier.

They'll make your life *better*.

There's a difference.

---

### [4:46-5:00] THE CLOSE - FINAL PUSH

**TOBY:**
Download the worksheet. Do it now.

Not later. Now.

Because "I'll do it later" is the excuse that's kept you stuck for months.

Maybe years.

**[DIRECT, INTENSE BUT SUPPORTIVE EYE CONTACT]**

**TOBY (continued):**
You know what to do.

Stop accepting excuses.

Write your mandates.

Change everything.

I'll see you on the other side.
