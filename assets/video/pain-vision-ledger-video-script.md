## SCRIPT BREAKDOWN

### [0:00 - 0:20] OPENING / HOOK

**[Visual: Simple intro - just you on camera, professional setting, charcoal background. Calm, focused energy.]**

**SCRIPT:**

"I'm going to walk you through the one exercise that shifted everything for me.

And it's simple. Maybe too simple.

But don't let simplicity fool you.

**[PAUSE - 2 seconds]**

This is called the Pain & Vision Ledger."

**[DELIVERY NOTES]**
- Speak slowly, deliberately
- Eye contact directly with camera
- Slight lean forward on "shifted everything"
- Pause is critical—let the name land

---

### [0:20 - 0:45] THE PROBLEM

**[Visual: Stay on camera. Slight lean forward for engagement.]**

**SCRIPT:**

"Most people spend their entire lives making decisions from pain.

Fear of failure. Shame about past mistakes. Anxiety about judgment.

And they never—and I mean *never*—write down what that's actually costing them.

So they don't realize they're choosing pain on repeat.

They think it's just 'how things are.'

But it's not. It's a choice. An unconscious choice."

**[DELIVERY NOTES]**
- Emphasis on "never" (slightly louder, slower)
- Pause before "An unconscious choice"
- Direct, matter-of-fact tone
- No dramatization—just truth

---

### [0:45 - 1:15] THE MECHANISM (Show Template)

**[Visual: Show template on screen - two-column ledger layout. Can be side-by-side with you, or full screen with voiceover.]**

**SCRIPT:**

"Here's what the Pain & Vision Ledger does.

It makes the unconscious conscious.

**Left side: THE PAIN.** You write down the specific cost of your current patterns.

Not 'I'm not making money.' Specific: '$47K a year less than I could be making.'

Not 'My family is distant.' Specific: 'I haven't had a real conversation with my kids in 6 months.'

Get brutally honest. Because you can't change what you don't see."

**[DELIVERY NOTES]**
- Pause after "unconscious conscious" (let it land)
- Speak examples slowly, clearly
- Emphasize contrast: generic vs. specific
- Tone: firm but compassionate

**[VISUAL NOTES]**
- Show template clearly
- Highlight left column when discussing "THE PAIN"
- Use annotations/arrows if needed

---

### [1:15 - 1:40] THE MAGIC (Psychology)

**[Visual: Camera back on you. Direct eye contact. Pause for emphasis.]**

**SCRIPT:**

"Here's where it gets interesting.

Once you write down the cost on the left side—the actual, specific cost—your brain won't let you ignore it.

It's not shame. It's clarity.

And clarity activates something.

Your nervous system goes from low-grade anxiety to focused attention."

**[DELIVERY NOTES]**
- Slightly slower on "It's not shame. It's clarity."
- Pause between sentences
- Calm, authoritative tone
- This is the psychological shift—make it clear

---

### [1:40 - 2:05] THE VISION (Right Column)

**[Visual: Show right column of template on screen.]**

**SCRIPT:**

"Then the right side: THE VISION.

Not dreams. Not fantasies. Concrete choices.

'I'm investing 2 hours weekly in my business, period.'

'I'm having one real family dinner per week, phones off.'

'I'm signing up for that course I've been avoiding.'

See the difference? Not 'I want to...'

'I *am* choosing to...'

That's powerful."

**[DELIVERY NOTES]**
- Read examples as commitments (firm, declarative)
- Emphasis on "am choosing" (present tense, active)
- Pause after "That's powerful"

**[VISUAL NOTES]**
- Show right column clearly
- Highlight examples as you read them
- Visual contrast between "want to" and "am choosing"

---

### [2:05 - 2:40] THE POWER (Integration)

**[Visual: Back to camera. Direct eye contact.]**

**SCRIPT:**

"The magic happens when you see both sides together.

Your brain hates contradiction.

When you see on the left: 'This costs me $150K over 5 years.'

And on the right: 'I'm building my business.'

...your whole system activates.

Not because you'll accomplish everything on the right side immediately.

But because you'll start making decisions differently.

From intention. Not pain.

From vision. Not fear."

**[DELIVERY NOTES]**
- Slower pacing on this section
- Let each idea land before moving to next
- Build momentum through the section
- Emphasize "From intention" and "From vision"

---

### [2:40 - 3:10] THE PRACTICE (28 Days)

**[Visual: Show someone reading the ledger (stock footage or real person), OR show 28-day calendar/tracker.]**

**SCRIPT:**

"Here's what most people miss:

You don't do this once.

You read it every single morning for 28 days.

Not to guilt yourself. To rewire yourself.

Your subconscious doesn't change in a day. It changes through repetition.

By day 28, you won't recognize yourself.

Not because you'll have solved everything.

But because you'll be thinking about your life differently."

**[DELIVERY NOTES]**
- Firm on "You don't do this once"
- Compassionate on "Not to guilt yourself"
- Hopeful but realistic on transformation

**[VISUAL NOTES]**
- Show visual of daily practice
- 28-day calendar or tracker
- Person reading ledger (morning routine)

**[Testimonial Example - read or show on screen]**

**Title**: "The Pain & Vision Ledger: How One Exercise Changes Everything"

**Description**:
```
Most people make decisions from pain—fear, shame, anxiety. They never write down what it's actually costing them. That's why they keep repeating the same patterns.

The Pain & Vision Ledger is a simple two-column exercise that reveals the exact cost of your current choices and creates written commitment to vision-based decisions.

In this video, I'll show you:
- Why your decision-making SYSTEM is the real problem
- How writing down costs activates your nervous system
- The 28-day practice that rewires your subconscious
- What happened when real people did this work

Research shows that people who write down their goals are 42% more likely to achieve them. Adding accountability increases success rate to 76%.

This isn't generic journaling. This is a commitment device backed by psychology.
