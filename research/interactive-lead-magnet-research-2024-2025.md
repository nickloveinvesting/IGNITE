**For Manual Personalized Audits (1-to-1):**
1. **Pre-qualify**: Email offer first → create video only for interested prospects (Intercom approach)
2. **Set expectations**: "I'll send you a 5-minute personalized video audit within 48 hours"
3. **Automate booking**: Use Calendly for audit requests
4. **Limit availability**: "5 free audits per week" creates scarcity
5. **Make it easy**: Only ask for URL/profile link + email
6. **Follow-up system**: Automated email sequence after video delivered
7. **Clear CTA in video**: End with specific next step (book call, download template)

**For AI-Powered Audits at Scale:**
1. **Instant delivery**: Use AI to generate audit immediately
2. **Preview**: Show sample audit before requiring email
3. **Freemium**: Basic audit free, detailed version gated
4. **Social proof**: "AI has audited 5,000+ websites"
5. **Minimal input**: Only need URL, AI does the rest
6. **Fast generation**: Under 60 seconds to generate
7. **Shareable**: Allow users to share their audit score (viral potential)

**Efficiency Tips (Manual Audits):**
- **Batch recording**: Set aside 2 hours, do 10 audits back-to-back
- **Template script**: Follow same structure for consistency
- **Time limit**: Set 5-minute timer, stay focused
- **Tools ready**: Have all analysis tools open before recording
- **Quick editing**: Use Loom's trim feature to remove long pauses
- **Automated delivery**: Zapier sends video link automatically when form submitted

**When to Use Personalized Video Audits:**
- ✅ High-ticket services ($3K+ packages)
- ✅ Complex B2B sales
- ✅ Consulting/coaching/agency services
- ✅ Building relationships, not just leads
- ✅ You can handle 5-20 requests per week
- ❌ Low-ticket products
- ❌ Need to scale to 1000s of leads
- ❌ B2C impulse purchases

**Scaling Consideration:** This is the LEAST scalable format but potentially HIGHEST converting for qualified leads. Best for service businesses where one client = $5K-$50K+ in revenue.
