## THE 6 PROVEN MANDATE FRAMEWORKS

### 1. THE FALSE BELIEFS CRUSHER (Russell Brunson)
**Pattern:** Identify false belief → Share epiphany story → Reveal truth → Create new belief → Mandate action
**Best For:** Educational audiences, story-driven brands
**Key Language:** "I used to believe... Then I discovered... Now I commit to..."

### 2. THE IDENTITY DECLARATION (James Clear)
**Pattern:** Define identity → Identify behaviors → Commit to "voting" → Set commitment devices → Track evidence
**Best For:** Long-term transformation, habit-based programs
**Key Language:** "I am the type of person who..." "Every action is a vote for..."

### 3. THE POWER INCANTATION (Tony Robbins)
**Pattern:** Present-tense statements → Emotional why → Physical movement → Full physiology → Daily ritual
**Best For:** High-energy brands, transformation coaching
**Key Language:** "I am [state]!" "I live each day with [quality]!" (Present tense, emotionally charged)

### 4. THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM (Brendon Burchard)
**Pattern:** Performance prompts → Written responses → Public declaration → Partner/community → Regular check-ins
**Best For:** Community-driven programs, ongoing accountability
**Key Language:** "If I was going to... the first three things..." "I publicly commit to..."

### 5. THE NON-NEGOTIABLE MANDATE (Andy Frisella - 75 Hard)
**Pattern:** 3-5 daily tasks → Specific duration → Black/white criteria → Restart rule → Daily documentation
**Best For:** Extreme commitment seekers, transformation challenges
**Key Language:** "No compromises, no substitutions, no exceptions" "If I miss any task, I start over"

### 6. THE COMMITMENT CONTRACT (Cialdini Principles)
**Pattern:** Specific goal → Clear deadline → Meaningful stakes → External referee → Signed contract → Public sharing
**Best For:** Goal-oriented audiences, specific outcomes
**Key Language:** "I, [name], commit to... by [date]" "If I do not complete... I will..."

## THE 7 ELEMENTS OF STRONG COMMITMENTS

1. **SPECIFICITY** - "Jog 20 minutes, 3x/week" NOT "Exercise more"
2. **USE "WILL"** - "I WILL" NOT "I should/might/can"
3. **DATES/TIMES** - "By Nov 30, 2025" NOT "Soon"
4. **PRESENT TENSE (identity)** - "I AM a runner" NOT "I want to run"
5. **PERSONAL PRONOUNS** - "I will" NOT "One should"
6. **ACTION VERBS** - "I commit to" NOT "I hope to"
7. **POSITIVE FRAMING** - "I will eat whole foods" NOT "I won't eat junk"

## EMPOWERING VS. SHAME LANGUAGE

### ❌ SHAME-BASED
- "I'm lazy and need to stop being a failure"
- "I am a quitter"
- "I always fail at this"
- "I have to do this or I'm worthless"

### ✅ EMPOWERMENT-BASED
- "I am capable of extraordinary discipline"
- "I quit last time, but I'm stronger now"
- "I've learned from past attempts"
- "I choose this because I value myself"

**KEY DISTINCTION:**
- Shame: "I AM a mistake"
- Guilt/Accountability: "I MADE a mistake"

## PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES (Cialdini)

- Physical act creates psychological ownership
- Handwritten > typed > mental

### Foot-in-the-Door

- Sign petition → donate money
- Free trial → paid subscription

### Public Commitments
- Social pressure increases consistency
- Coca-Cola "Share a Coke": 11% sales increase
- Public declaration puts "ego on the line"

### Identity-Based Habits (James Clear)
- "Incentives start a habit. Identity sustains a habit."
- "Every action is a vote for who you're becoming"
- Focus on WHO not WHAT

**Option 3 - Call Out:**
